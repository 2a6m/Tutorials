text The last figure shows the implementation of the CANBus. The implementation is quite easy because of the modules proposed by Microchip. A node is made of a transceiver, a CAN controller and a microcontroller. Transceiver Microchip proposes a lot of solutions for the automotive including a transceiver. It is the MCP2562. Formerly the MCP2551, is used to convert the TTL signal to a differential signal required by the CANBus. Controller Microchip also proposes the CAN controller MCP2515 which implements all the CAN 2.0 specifications. It is able to send and receive data and communicate it via SPI to a microcontroller. Microcontroller. Any microcontroller with an integrated SPI communication can be selected. For example we can take the famous ATMEGA328p known for his arduino IDE. Resistance In every communication wire there is some reflexion that can corrupt the data. It can be avoided by using 120 Ohm resistor at the end of line.

The following section presents these boards, it utilities and it conception and gives you all the necessary elements to understand, recreate and use it. ##Starting Board Inspired by past version of the starting board The utility of this PCB is to gather the component serving to the start sequence. Normally this is the only interface with the robot during the competition. First, we used three switches for configuring three mains points of our robot : Team configuration We have to setup the starting side for the next match to the robot. It behaviour is different if the robot play as the green or the orange team. Consequently, this switch set this point before the match start. Strategy Configuration It makes possible to choose between two kinds of implemented strategies before the match. For example, just before the start, we have the possibility of aggressive or defensive strategy, function of the opponent. Initialisation Switch This switch launches an initialisation sequence. After the power up of the robot and before its first move, we wanted to have the possibility to check all different robot's systems. This switch indicates with a DEL if all systems are operational. This is a kind of automatic check list before the match and the first move of the robot. All these switches are linked to two DEL. First one to electrically confirm switches' position and the associated setting and the second one used to have the response of the robot operating system. With these two DELs, we are sure that our robot understood all these parameters. Correspondence Strategy Pin 1 - UP = GREEN = 0 (out raspberry) - DOWN = RED = 1 (out raspberry) Initialisation Pin 2 - UP = GREEN = 0 (out raspberry) - DOWN = RED = 1 (out raspberry) Team Pin 3 - LEFT = GREEN = 1 (out raspberry) - RIGHT = RED = 1 (out raspberry) Start Pin 4 - piece IN = 0 (out raspberry) - piece OUT = 1 (out raspberry) Switch placement The emplacement is taken when the splayed side is on the right then : Strategy switch is in the upper left corner Initialisation switch is on the right side of the strategy switch Team switch is in the lower left corner Finally, the starter switch is plugged on the board. It consists of a relay, sending a binary information to the ROS operating system.

Once the photo has been taken, the camera automatically switches off and we connect to the robot by wifi (a Raspberry connected with the same Wi-Fi for future image treatment). During this treatment, we use the OpenCV free graphics library. We have drawn three frames on the picture (one for each cube to detect) to delimit the test portion. The board analyzes all pixels within each frame: It looks whether the color detected is in the range color defined for every color (each color range is defined with one high and one low BGR value) After that, it returns a value: more the value is great, more the color lies within the range. The program adds up the values and the final value thus obtained determines the color within the range of colors determined initially. However, we have implemented in our program the different possible combinations to save time. Indeed, we only required two colors to deduce the final combination.

The pin used here is the 13 but of course you can change it in the code if you want to use another one. As in the Arduino Publisher Tutorial you first have to include the libraries. One of them depends on the message you are transferring with ROS. In the following example we will choose an empty message. This means that the message doesn’t contain anything. So when the subscriber receives the message, it doesn’t react depending on its content but it only reacts because a message has been sent. As the type of the std_msg is «Empty», you have to include the following lines at the beginning of your Arduino code : #include <ros.h>\n#include <std_msgs/Empty.h> Here again, like the Arduino Publisher Tutorial code, you have to start a ROS node with this line : ros::NodeHandle nh; Then you initiate the callback function where you have to specify the name of the callback (messageCb), the type of the message (std_msgs::Empty) and the name of the message (toggle_msg which contains the transferred message). The callback is the function called each time you receive a message. If toggle_msg had a content you could use it in the callback but it is not the case here as the message is of type «Empty». void messageCb( const std_msgs::Empty& toggle_msg){ digitalWrite(13, HIGH-digitalRead(13)); // blink the led\n} The following line of code is used to instantiate the subscriber. To do so you have to specify two arguments : the topic name (we chose in this example : «toggle_led») and the callback function we defined previously (messageCb). ros::Subscriber<std_msgs::Empty> sub(\"toggle_led\", &messageCb ); As this is a blink led example, in the setup part of your Arduino code you first have to use the number 13 pin as an output. pinMode(13, OUTPUT); Then for the ROS part of the setup you have to first initialize the node : nh.initNode(); And subscribe to the node you want to : nh.subscribe(sub); So finally this is what the void setup() in your Arduino code should look like : void setup()\n{ pinMode(13, OUTPUT); nh.initNode(); nh.subscribe(sub);\n} Finally you just have to add in the void loop of your Arduino code the following lines where the spinOnce passes arguments to the callback : void loop()\n{ nh.spinOnce(); delay(1);\n} Now that you know how each part of the code works you can test the blink led example available on the wiki.ros.org website http://wiki.ros.org/rosserial_arduino/Tutorials/Blink : /* * rosserial Subscriber Example * Blinks an LED on callback */\n#include <ros.h>\n#include <std_msgs/Empty.h> ros::NodeHandle nh; void messageCb( const std_msgs::Empty& toggle_msg){ digitalWrite(13, HIGH-digitalRead(13)); // blink the led\n} ros::Subscriber<std_msgs::Empty> sub(\"toggle_led\", &messageCb ); void setup()\n{ pinMode(13, OUTPUT); nh.initNode(); nh.subscribe(sub);\n} void loop()\n{ nh.spinOnce(); delay(1);\n} You have to upload this code on the Arduino board before connecting it to the Raspberry and before starting the test on ROS."},"software/ros/basics/basics.html#messages":{"title":"Messages","id":"software/ros/basics/basics.html#messages","body":"A node sends information to another node using messages that are published by topics.

This tutorial explains the code to use and transfer sonar sensors information with ROS. For the «Cortex» robot we used four sensors, one on each side so that’s what the final code presented at the end of this tutorial is based on. Firstly, in this code we are going to include the same libraries as shown in the Arduino Publisher Tutorial so you can refer to that part for the explanations. An additional useful library used for the sensors is the NewPing.h. So here are all the necessary libraries : #include <ros.h>\n#include <sensor_msgs/Range.h>\n#include <NewPing.h> Then you have to define the pins for each sensor. In this case, the ultrasound sensor has two pins (Trigger ans Echo). Here is an exemple with the sensor located on the right of the robot: #define TRIGGER_PINR 5\n#define ECHO_PINR 4 You also have to specify the maximum distance at which you want the sensor to still be able to detect : #define MAX_DISTANCE 300 Now as we are using the NewPing library you can simply create an ultrasound sensor object by doing this : NewPing sonarR(TRIGGER_PINR, ECHO_PINR, MAX_DISTANCE); where you specify the pins and the maximum distance defined previously. Moreover as mentioned in the Arduino Publisher Tutorial you specify the type of the ultrasound message and the name you want to assign to it : sensor_msgs::Range range_msg_right; You also have to add the following line which has also been explained in the Arduino Publisher Tutorial : ros::Publisher pub_range4(\"ultrasound_right\", &range_msg_right); We then have to fill each sonar object with the initialisation information associated : range_msg_right.radiation_type = sensor_msgs::Range::ULTRASOUND;\nrange_msg_right.header.frame_id = \"ultrasound_right\";\nrange_msg_right.field_of_view = 0.3665; // fake\nrange_msg_right.min_range = 0.0;\nrange_msg_right.max_range = MAX_DISTANCE; Now we can add parts to the void loop of the Arduino code. The most important and useful one specifies the distance to an obstacle : range_msg_right.range = tmp/100; We can then publish that information about the distance (you can again refer to the Arduino Publisher Tutorial for the publishing part) : pub_range4.publish(&range_msg_right); Here is the whole code for four ultrasound sensors based on the one presented in this link : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm3e-51ohgQ #include <ros.h>\n#include <sensor_msgs/Range.h>\n#include <NewPing.h> #define TRIGGER_PINR 5 //back\n#define ECHO_PINR 4 #define TRIGGER_PINL 7 //front\n#define ECHO_PINL 6 #define TRIGGER_PINB 12 //left\n#define ECHO_PINB 13 #define TRIGGER_PINF 11 //right\n#define ECHO_PINF 10 #define MAX_DISTANCE 300 // Maximum distance we want to ping NewPing sonarL(TRIGGER_PINL, ECHO_PINL, MAX_DISTANCE); // back us NewPing sonarR(TRIGGER_PINR, ECHO_PINR, MAX_DISTANCE); // front us\nNewPing sonarB(TRIGGER_PINB, ECHO_PINB, MAX_DISTANCE); // left us\nNewPing sonarF(TRIGGER_PINF, ECHO_PINF, MAX_DISTANCE); // right us ros::NodeHandle nh; sensor_msgs::Range range_msg_rear;\nsensor_msgs::Range range_msg_front;\nsensor_msgs::Range range_msg_left;\nsensor_msgs::Range range_msg_right;\nros::Publisher pub_range1(\"ultrasound_rear\", &range_msg_rear);\nros::Publisher pub_range2(\"ultrasound_front\", &range_msg_front);\nros::Publisher pub_range3(\"ultrasound_left\", &range_msg_left);\nros::Publisher pub_range4(\"ultrasound_right\", &range_msg_right); char frameid[] = \"base_link\"; long duration; float tmp; void setup()\n{ nh.initNode(); nh.advertise(pub_range1); nh.advertise(pub_range2); nh.advertise(pub_range3); nh.advertise(pub_range4); range_msg_rear.radiation_type = sensor_msgs::Range::ULTRASOUND; range_msg_rear.header.frame_id = \"ultrasound_rear\"; range_msg_rear.field_of_view = 0.3665; // fake range_msg_rear.min_range = 0.0; range_msg_rear.max_range = MAX_DISTANCE; range_msg_front.radiation_type = sensor_msgs::Range::ULTRASOUND; range_msg_front.header.frame_id = \"ultrasound_front\"; range_msg_front.field_of_view = 0.3665; // fake range_msg_front.min_range = 0.0; range_msg_front.max_range = MAX_DISTANCE; range_msg_left.radiation_type = sensor_msgs::Range::ULTRASOUND; range_msg_left.header.frame_id = \"ultrasound_front\"; range_msg_left.field_of_view = 0.3665; // fake range_msg_left.min_range = 0.0; range_msg_left.max_range = MAX_DISTANCE; range_msg_right.radiation_type = sensor_msgs::Range::ULTRASOUND; range_msg_right.header.frame_id = \"ultrasound_right\"; range_msg_right.field_of_view = 0.3665; // fake range_msg_right.min_range = 0.0; range_msg_right.max_range = MAX_DISTANCE;\n} long range_time; void loop()\n{ //publish the adc value every 50 milliseconds //since it takes that long for the sensor to stabilize if ( millis() >= range_time ){ tmp=sonarL.ping_cm(); range_msg_rear.range = tmp/100; range_msg_rear.header.stamp = nh.now(); pub_range1.publish(&range_msg_rear); tmp=sonarR.ping_cm(); range_msg_front.range = tmp/100; range_msg_front.header.stamp = nh.now(); pub_range2.publish(&range_msg_front); tmp=sonarB.ping_cm(); range_msg_left.range = tmp/100; range_msg_left.header.stamp = nh.now(); pub_range2.publish(&range_msg_left); tmp=sonarF.ping_cm(); range_msg_right.range = tmp/100; range_msg_right.header.stamp = nh.now(); pub_range4.publish(&range_msg_right); range_time = millis() + 50; } nh.spinOnce();\n}","breadcrumbs":"Electronics » Sensors » Sonar","title":"Sonar","id":"electronics/sensors/sonar.html#sonar"},"mechanical/fusion.html#project-view":{"title":"Project view","breadcrumbs":"Mechanical » Project view","id":"mechanical/fusion.html#project-view","body":"img We'll let you listen to M.Christensen by clicking on the links of the videos we gave earlier to learn the basics of Fusion360.

So, our advice is the following, as soon as a board is functional and definitive, send it to have a proper and reliable board. Moreover, try to reach this step as soon as possible. Connection We have underestimated the connection on the different board. Regarding the JST connector, they are solid but hard to disconnect and cable creation is long withtout the right tool. About the 10 pins shrouded header, they are not reliable enough. Opposite to the JST, disconnection is too easy. We really advise against its use.

Here are the different types of std_msgs : http://wiki.ros.org/std_msgs . You can also use different kind of messages. For instance the ultrasound sensors use : #include <sensor_msgs/Range.h> Then you have to start a ROS node (takes care of serial port communications, allows to create publishers and subscribers) with this line : ros::NodeHandle nh; You can now create a message object that you will later fill with data and this is the message you will finally publish : std_msgs::String msg; where msg is the name of the object. And of course you can choose the type of the message depending on the type of the transferred message. Then you have to choose if you want to create a publisher, a subscriber or even both. To create a publisher : ros::Publisher chatter(\"chatter\", &msg); This tells that we are going to be publishing a message of the type of the msg variable (with std_msgs::String type) on the topic «chatter». This lets the master tell any nodes listening on «chatter» that we are going to publish data on that topic. You can now add lines in the void setup() of the Arduino script. You first initialize the node : nh.initNode() Next, the following call connects to the master to publicize that the node will be publishing messages on the given topic : nh.advertise(chatter); So finally this is what the void setup() in your Arduino code should look like : void setup()\n{ nh.initNode(); nh.advertise(chatter);\n} To fill the message object with the data you just have to do this : msg.data = hello; where hello is the data you put in your message and hello must have the same type as the msg variable. You can then publish you message on the topic. To do so you can either publish it once or continually in the void loop() of your Arduino code like this : void loop()\n{ chatter.publish( &str_msg );\n} Finally you have to add a last line of code in the loop that will call all the callbacks waiting to be called at that point in time : nh.spinOnce(); Now that you know how each part of the code works you can test a «Hello World» example available on the wiki.ros.org website http://wiki.ros.org/rosserial_arduino/Tutorials/Hello%20World : /* * rosserial Publisher Example * Prints \"hello world!\" */\n// Use the following line if you have a Leonardo or MKR1000 //#define USE_USBCON #include <ros.h>\n#include <std_msgs/String.h> ros::NodeHandle nh; std_msgs::String str_msg;\nros::Publisher chatter(\"chatter\", &str_msg); char hello[13] = \"hello world!\"; void setup()\n{ nh.initNode(); nh.advertise(chatter);\n} void loop()\n{ str_msg.data = hello; chatter.publish( &str_msg ); nh.spinOnce(); delay(1000);\n} You have to upload this code on the Arduino board before connecting it to the Raspberry and before starting the test on ROS.","title":"Publisher","breadcrumbs":"Software » ROS » ROS and Arduino » Publisher","id":"software/ros/arduino/publisher.html#publisher"},"electronics/communication/can.html#electronic-problem":{"title":"Electronic problem","breadcrumbs":"Electronics » Communication » Electronic problem","id":"electronics/communication/can.html#electronic-problem","body":"Once the boards are installend on the robots, they needed a lot of connections between them.

You can see on the picture below the topology of this communictaion interface and the pinout of the components: To begin a communication with a Slave , the Master must fix the Slave Select pin (SS) to LOW state. After that, the master can put somme bit into the shift register throught the MOSI (Master Output Slave Input) pin. There isn't any standard communiction protocol but the communiction frame is often writen for the use. When the communication is done, it's the master who must put back the SS to HIGH State. Note : It's a full duplex interface, The slave can push some data on his MISO (Master Input Slave Output) pin during the communication. ###advantages Full duplex communication Flexibility of the number of bits to be transmitted as well as the protocol itself no possible collision ###disadvantage (3 + N*Slaves) pins are required on the master 4 pins are required on each slaves Master can speak in a vacuum without knowing it Bus can only count one master ##Use of our SPI the communication frame we used to send data to the slave is: Register adress on 8 bits Number of bytes composing the message Message Note : to read some data from a slave's register, the master must just send the register adress. The slave push the data on his MISO (Master Input Slave Output) pin. ###Our Master Create a SPI Master is really easy with a atmega328p and the arduino IDE. Indeed, we can find easily some libraries. We used the one provided directly by the arduino IDE in an object that we implemented : SPIManager how to work with SPIManager object will be illustrated at least code use for Cortex's engines control (Eurobot 2018) : MotorBroker #####1. Initialisation of the SPI communication The SPIManager object must be seen as a communication channel with the slave. It will be necessary to instantiate one SPIManager object by slave. When creating the object, use the number of the SS pin as an argument. //Define the SS pin for each slave\n#define FL_SS 9\n#define FR_SS 2\n#define BL_SS 10\n#define BR_SS 3 //Object Instantiation\nSPIManager connFL(FL_SS);\nSPIManager connFR(FR_SS);\nSPIManager connBL(BL_SS);\nSPIManager connBR(BR_SS); Use the initialize() method to activate the communication channel. This call should be placed in the setup() function of the arduino code. connFL.initialize(); #####2. Write data to a Slave's register as said above, to write a value in a register of the slave will first send the address of the register, then the size in number of byte and to finish, the message. The writedata function has been written to make its use as intuitive as possible. below, an example of use where we send to the register 16 (0x10), the message x.b whose size is 4 bytes . connBR.writeData(0x10, 0x04, x.b); #####3. Read data from a Slave's register There are two functions to read some data: the first, readLongData , will return a value of type long and the other , readData , a value of type float32 below, an example of use where we get some data from th register 81 (0x51). encoders_msg.rear_left = connBL.readLongData(0x51); from here the documentation is still being written ###Our Slaves When using the Arduino IDE to program atmeg328p, the slave mode is not available. Two registers must be modified to activate this mode : // turn on SPI in slave mode\nSPCR |= _BV(SPE);\n// turn on interrupts\nSPCR |= _BV(SPIE); So that these manipulations are transparent for the user we also create an object for the SPI bus slaves : SPISlave this object has several methods : begin() reset() com() and some properties : command dataSize msg endtrans #####1. Initialisation of the SPI communication SpiSlave mySPI;\n//SLK : pin 13\n//MISO : pin 12\n//MOSI : pin 11 #define SS 10 mySPI.begin(); #####2. Interruption //Interrupt needed by SPI Communication\nISR (SPI_STC_vect) { mySPI.com(SPDR); spiReg();//Function called at the end of the communication. } #####3. Registers void spiReg(){ switch (mySPI.command) { case 0x10: if(mySPI.endTrans) { for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++){ motor_speed.b[i] = mySPI.msg[i]; } } break; case 0x11: SPDR = motor_speed.b[mySPI.dataCount - 2]; break; case 0x50: motor_encoder.write(0); break; case 0x51: SPDR = EncoderState.b[mySPI.dataCount - 2]; break; } } ###Troubleshooting #####1.
