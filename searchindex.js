This causes the output to momentarily have an incorrect value. The problem compounds as the signal travels through more gates and wires. In Building Math Hardware we created elementary math operations using combinatorial circuits. That was OK, because we didn’t care about such output glitches caused by the input signals propagating to the outputs. From a demonstrator’s point of view it even made it more interesting. Talking to a real device, such as a SPI master is different, because it requires the outputs to be stable at certain times. z The solution is to introduce a clock signal, and store the signals in a flip-flop (registers) at the rising edge of that clock signal. We then only need to ensure that the longest delay from one flip-flop to the next is less that the clock period. This greatly simplifies the design process, at the cost of introducing some delay.","breadcrumbs":"Electronics » 5.1. Sequential circuit","title":"5.1.

During this treatment, we use the OpenCV free graphics library. We have drawn three frames on the picture (one for each cube to detect) to delimit the test portion. The board analyzes all pixels within each frame: It looks whether the color detected is in the range color defined for every color (each color range is defined with one high and one low BGR value) After that, it returns a value: more the value is great, more the color lies within the range. The program adds up the values and the final value thus obtained determines the color within the range of colors determined initially. However, we have implemented in our program the different possible combinations to save time. Indeed, we only required two colors to deduce the final combination.

To do so you can either publish it once or continually in the void loop() of your Arduino code like this : void loop()\n{ chatter.publish( &str_msg );\n} Finally you have to add a last line of code in the loop that will call all the callbacks waiting to be called at that point in time : nh.spinOnce(); Now that you know how each part of the code works you can test a «Hello World» example available on the wiki.ros.org website http://wiki.ros.org/rosserial_arduino/Tutorials/Hello%20World : /* * rosserial Publisher Example * Prints \"hello world!\" */\n// Use the following line if you have a Leonardo or MKR1000 //#define USE_USBCON #include <ros.h>\n#include <std_msgs/String.h> ros::NodeHandle nh; std_msgs::String str_msg;\nros::Publisher chatter(\"chatter\", &str_msg); char hello[13] = \"hello world!\"; void setup()\n{ nh.initNode(); nh.advertise(chatter);\n} void loop()\n{ str_msg.data = hello; chatter.publish( &str_msg ); nh.spinOnce(); delay(1000);\n} You have to upload this code on the Arduino board before connecting it to the Raspberry and before starting the test on ROS.","breadcrumbs":"Software » ROS » ROS and Arduino » Publisher","title":"Publisher"},"software/ros/basics/workspace.html#workspaces":{"title":"Workspaces","id":"software/ros/basics/workspace.html#workspaces","breadcrumbs":"Software » ROS » Basic concepts » Workspaces","body":"The first thing you will want to do before you write code is create an environnement for your project.

The first flip-flop creates a synchronous version of the inputs by clocking it with the system clock. The input signal could change within the flip-flop’s setup and hold times and may take longer than a system clock cycle to settle to a stable value (metastability).

This tutorial explains the code to use and transfer sonar sensors information with ROS. For the «Cortex» robot we used four sensors, one on each side so that’s what the final code presented at the end of this tutorial is based on. Firstly, in this code we are going to include the same libraries as shown in the Arduino Publisher Tutorial so you can refer to that part for the explanations. An additional useful library used for the sensors is the NewPing.h. So here are all the necessary libraries : #include <ros.h>\n#include <sensor_msgs/Range.h>\n#include <NewPing.h> Then you have to define the pins for each sensor. In this case, the ultrasound sensor has two pins (Trigger ans Echo). Here is an exemple with the sensor located on the right of the robot: #define TRIGGER_PINR 5\n#define ECHO_PINR 4 You also have to specify the maximum distance at which you want the sensor to still be able to detect : #define MAX_DISTANCE 300 Now as we are using the NewPing library you can simply create an ultrasound sensor object by doing this : NewPing sonarR(TRIGGER_PINR, ECHO_PINR, MAX_DISTANCE); where you specify the pins and the maximum distance defined previously. Moreover as mentioned in the Arduino Publisher Tutorial you specify the type of the ultrasound message and the name you want to assign to it : sensor_msgs::Range range_msg_right; You also have to add the following line which has also been explained in the Arduino Publisher Tutorial : ros::Publisher pub_range4(\"ultrasound_right\", &range_msg_right); We then have to fill each sonar object with the initialisation information associated : range_msg_right.radiation_type = sensor_msgs::Range::ULTRASOUND;\nrange_msg_right.header.frame_id = \"ultrasound_right\";\nrange_msg_right.field_of_view = 0.3665; // fake\nrange_msg_right.min_range = 0.0;\nrange_msg_right.max_range = MAX_DISTANCE; Now we can add parts to the void loop of the Arduino code.

The pin used here is the 13 but of course you can change it in the code if you want to use another one. As in the Arduino Publisher Tutorial you first have to include the libraries. One of them depends on the message you are transferring with ROS. In the following example we will choose an empty message. This means that the message doesn’t contain anything. So when the subscriber receives the message, it doesn’t react depending on its content but it only reacts because a message has been sent. As the type of the std_msg is «Empty», you have to include the following lines at the beginning of your Arduino code : #include <ros.h>\n#include <std_msgs/Empty.h> Here again, like the Arduino Publisher Tutorial code, you have to start a ROS node with this line : ros::NodeHandle nh; Then you initiate the callback function where you have to specify the name of the callback (messageCb), the type of the message (std_msgs::Empty) and the name of the message (toggle_msg which contains the transferred message). The callback is the function called each time you receive a message. If toggle_msg had a content you could use it in the callback but it is not the case here as the message is of type «Empty». void messageCb( const std_msgs::Empty& toggle_msg){ digitalWrite(13, HIGH-digitalRead(13)); // blink the led\n} The following line of code is used to instantiate the subscriber. To do so you have to specify two arguments : the topic name (we chose in this example : «toggle_led») and the callback function we defined previously (messageCb). ros::Subscriber<std_msgs::Empty> sub(\"toggle_led\", &messageCb ); As this is a blink led example, in the setup part of your Arduino code you first have to use the number 13 pin as an output. pinMode(13, OUTPUT); Then for the ROS part of the setup you have to first initialize the node : nh.initNode(); And subscribe to the node you want to : nh.subscribe(sub); So finally this is what the void setup() in your Arduino code should look like : void setup()\n{ pinMode(13, OUTPUT); nh.initNode(); nh.subscribe(sub);\n} Finally you just have to add in the void loop of your Arduino code the following lines where the spinOnce passes arguments to the callback : void loop()\n{ nh.spinOnce(); delay(1);\n} Now that you know how each part of the code works you can test the blink led example available on the wiki.ros.org website http://wiki.ros.org/rosserial_arduino/Tutorials/Blink : /* * rosserial Subscriber Example * Blinks an LED on callback */\n#include <ros.h>\n#include <std_msgs/Empty.h> ros::NodeHandle nh; void messageCb( const std_msgs::Empty& toggle_msg){ digitalWrite(13, HIGH-digitalRead(13)); // blink the led\n} ros::Subscriber<std_msgs::Empty> sub(\"toggle_led\", &messageCb ); void setup()\n{ pinMode(13, OUTPUT); nh.initNode(); nh.subscribe(sub);\n} void loop()\n{ nh.spinOnce(); delay(1);\n} You have to upload this code on the Arduino board before connecting it to the Raspberry and before starting the test on ROS."},"software/ros/packages/packages.html#useful-packages":{"title":"Useful packages","body":"","id":"software/ros/packages/packages.html#useful-packages","breadcrumbs":"Software » ROS » Useful packages"},"electronics/fpga.html#a6-message-exchange-protocol":{"breadcrumbs":"Electronics » 6.
