The rosserial protocol is aimed at point-to-point ROS communications over a serial transmission line. We use the same serialization/de-serialization as standard ROS messages, simply adding a packet header and tail which allows multiple topics to share a common serial link. » These explanations come from the following websites : http://wiki.ros.org/rosserial http://wiki.ros.org/rosserial_arduino/Tutorials/Arduino%20IDE%20Setup Now you know what rosserial is used for, but before testing you have to install some packages.","id":"software/ros/rosserial.html#what-is-rosserial-","title":"What is rosserial ?","breadcrumbs":"Software » ROS » What is rosserial ?"},"electronics/fpga.html#a221-pin-outs":{"id":"electronics/fpga.html#a221-pin-outs","title":"2.2.1.

That event triggers the lift and thus the block starts to raise up. Therefore we are using another DC motor with a belt as you can see on the picture below. img Thanks to the colour detection we know in which order we have to collect the blocks on the field, so we also know which one comes first in the lift and which floor it has to go to. It is important to know the specific floor in order to create the pattern showed at the beginning of the game and recognised by the colour and sequence recognition part. To know when the lift has to stop, we use the encoder of the DC motor so we can precisely know when the motor has to stop. The encoder is connected to an interruption pin on the Arduino board so the tick counts can be more accurate and have priority. Once the block is on the right floor, it has to be pushed outside of the lift to already be placed in its position on the tower on a kind of shelf (as you can see in the picture below) which supports the blocks even if there is no other block below. img Furthermore, to push the block, we use a dynamixel with a gear and a tooth rack to slide a plate along which pushes the block until it reaches the « shelf ». img Then the lift (without any block inside) goes down. To make sure it doesn’t go too much we use another limit switch. Therefore the lift is immediately stopped, another cube comes in and we can do the cube lifting steps mentioned before over again until all the cubes of the tower are placed. As mentioned above, we are using DC motors to control our lift. We have in all 3 motors and they are all connected to a L298 driver (see picture below) controlled by an Arduino Uno board. img We use 2 motors for the rollers to collect the blocks. In order to do so, each one has to turn in the opposite direction of the other but at the same speed. Thus we connected them to the same driver but inverted the pins of one motor compared to the other one. These motors don’t have an encoder so their only 2 pins are connected to the driver. We also have the third motor to make the lift go up and down. As we said before, we use the encoder to know where we have to stop so there are pins of the motor connected to the Arduino board. On the other hand the motor is also connected to the driver so we can control its speed, stop it and launch it.","id":"mechanical/2018/bigRobot.html#the-lift","breadcrumbs":"Mechanical » 2018 specifics » The lift"},"mechanical/mecanum.html#assembly":{"body":"","id":"mechanical/mecanum.html#assembly","title":"Assembly","breadcrumbs":"Mechanical » Assembly"},"software/ros/basics/packages.html#rosrun":{"breadcrumbs":"Software » ROS » Basic concepts » rosrun","body":"To run a package, we use the rosrun command executed like this: rosrun PACKAGE EXECUTABLE [ARGS] PACKAGE is the name of the created package, for example my_awesome_code , and EXECUTABLE is the name of the python file containing the code.

If you need further information and explanations for this code, you can refer to the Sonar Sensor Tutorial in the Electronics part. You can also use that tutorial for the wiring of the sonar on your Arduino. Of course you have to choose the pin numbers so they correspond to the ones declared in the code previously mentionned or you can directly change in the code the pin numbers yourself. Then you have to connect the Arduino board to the Raspberry. To do so you can simply connect them with the serial Arduino cable to the Raspberry USB port as shown on the figure below. img Image reference : http://www.instructables.com/id/Raspberry-Pi-Arduino-Serial-Communication/ After that, you have to launch the terminal and execute the following commands : on a first window you type : roscore on another window : rosrun rosserial_python serial_node.py /dev/ttyUSB0 /dev/ttyUSB0 is the usb port the Arduino is connected to so you’ll have to change the «USB0». You can find the name of the port tty* in the Arduino IDE or you can find it in the terminal by typing : ls /dev/tty* when you plug the Arduino in the Raspberry port, you can execute this previous command to see which port has been added and thus know which one is the Arduino board.

In Building Math Hardware we created elementary math operations using combinatorial circuits. That was OK, because we didn’t care about such output glitches caused by the input signals propagating to the outputs. From a demonstrator’s point of view it even made it more interesting. Talking to a real device, such as a SPI master is different, because it requires the outputs to be stable at certain times. z The solution is to introduce a clock signal, and store the signals in a flip-flop (registers) at the rising edge of that clock signal. We then only need to ensure that the longest delay from one flip-flop to the next is less that the clock period.

Here, we have chosen a GoPro as a camera because it has an acceptable quality (780 pixel-HD) and it has also a Wi-Fi module for the remote control. Once the photo has been taken, the camera automatically switches off and we connect to the robot by wifi (a Raspberry connected with the same Wi-Fi for future image treatment). During this treatment, we use the OpenCV free graphics library. We have drawn three frames on the picture (one for each cube to detect) to delimit the test portion. The board analyzes all pixels within each frame: It looks whether the color detected is in the range color defined for every color (each color range is defined with one high and one low BGR value) After that, it returns a value: more the value is great, more the color lies within the range. The program adds up the values and the final value thus obtained determines the color within the range of colors determined initially. However, we have implemented in our program the different possible combinations to save time. Indeed, we only required two colors to deduce the final combination.

Firstly, you have to send a signal on the TRIG pin so the sonar emits a wave of 8 pulses at 40kHz. Then the ECHO pin is set to the «HIGH» level until the emitted signal goes to the obstacle and comes back to the sensor (as you can see on the following picture). img Of course, you have to connect the sensor to a microcontroller.

The pin used here is the 13 but of course you can change it in the code if you want to use another one. As in the Arduino Publisher Tutorial you first have to include the libraries. One of them depends on the message you are transferring with ROS. In the following example we will choose an empty message. This means that the message doesn’t contain anything. So when the subscriber receives the message, it doesn’t react depending on its content but it only reacts because a message has been sent. As the type of the std_msg is «Empty», you have to include the following lines at the beginning of your Arduino code : #include <ros.h>\n#include <std_msgs/Empty.h> Here again, like the Arduino Publisher Tutorial code, you have to start a ROS node with this line : ros::NodeHandle nh; Then you initiate the callback function where you have to specify the name of the callback (messageCb), the type of the message (std_msgs::Empty) and the name of the message (toggle_msg which contains the transferred message). The callback is the function called each time you receive a message. If toggle_msg had a content you could use it in the callback but it is not the case here as the message is of type «Empty». void messageCb( const std_msgs::Empty& toggle_msg){ digitalWrite(13, HIGH-digitalRead(13)); // blink the led\n} The following line of code is used to instantiate the subscriber. To do so you have to specify two arguments : the topic name (we chose in this example : «toggle_led») and the callback function we defined previously (messageCb). ros::Subscriber<std_msgs::Empty> sub(\"toggle_led\", &messageCb ); As this is a blink led example, in the setup part of your Arduino code you first have to use the number 13 pin as an output. pinMode(13, OUTPUT); Then for the ROS part of the setup you have to first initialize the node : nh.initNode(); And subscribe to the node you want to : nh.subscribe(sub); So finally this is what the void setup() in your Arduino code should look like : void setup()\n{ pinMode(13, OUTPUT); nh.initNode(); nh.subscribe(sub);\n} Finally you just have to add in the void loop of your Arduino code the following lines where the spinOnce passes arguments to the callback : void loop()\n{ nh.spinOnce(); delay(1);\n} Now that you know how each part of the code works you can test the blink led example available on the wiki.ros.org website http://wiki.ros.org/rosserial_arduino/Tutorials/Blink : /* * rosserial Subscriber Example * Blinks an LED on callback */\n#include <ros.h>\n#include <std_msgs/Empty.h> ros::NodeHandle nh; void messageCb( const std_msgs::Empty& toggle_msg){ digitalWrite(13, HIGH-digitalRead(13)); // blink the led\n} ros::Subscriber<std_msgs::Empty> sub(\"toggle_led\", &messageCb ); void setup()\n{ pinMode(13, OUTPUT); nh.initNode(); nh.subscribe(sub);\n} void loop()\n{ nh.spinOnce(); delay(1);\n} You have to upload this code on the Arduino board before connecting it to the Raspberry and before starting the test on ROS.","id":"software/ros/arduino/subscriber.html#subscriber"},"organization/gh-admin.html#invite-members":{"title":"Invite members","breadcrumbs":"Organization » GitHub » Invite members","body":"Now that everything is setup, we still need to invite the people who will be participating with you this year and assign them to the correct teams.

For the «Cortex» robot we used four sensors, one on each side so that’s what the final code presented at the end of this tutorial is based on. Firstly, in this code we are going to include the same libraries as shown in the Arduino Publisher Tutorial so you can refer to that part for the explanations. An additional useful library used for the sensors is the NewPing.h. So here are all the necessary libraries : #include <ros.h>\n#include <sensor_msgs/Range.h>\n#include <NewPing.h> Then you have to define the pins for each sensor. In this case, the ultrasound sensor has two pins (Trigger ans Echo). Here is an exemple with the sensor located on the right of the robot: #define TRIGGER_PINR 5\n#define ECHO_PINR 4 You also have to specify the maximum distance at which you want the sensor to still be able to detect : #define MAX_DISTANCE 300 Now as we are using the NewPing library you can simply create an ultrasound sensor object by doing this : NewPing sonarR(TRIGGER_PINR, ECHO_PINR, MAX_DISTANCE); where you specify the pins and the maximum distance defined previously. Moreover as mentioned in the Arduino Publisher Tutorial you specify the type of the ultrasound message and the name you want to assign to it : sensor_msgs::Range range_msg_right; You also have to add the following line which has also been explained in the Arduino Publisher Tutorial : ros::Publisher pub_range4(\"ultrasound_right\", &range_msg_right); We then have to fill each sonar object with the initialisation information associated : range_msg_right.radiation_type = sensor_msgs::Range::ULTRASOUND;\nrange_msg_right.header.frame_id = \"ultrasound_right\";\nrange_msg_right.field_of_view = 0.3665; // fake\nrange_msg_right.min_range = 0.0;\nrange_msg_right.max_range = MAX_DISTANCE; Now we can add parts to the void loop of the Arduino code. The most important and useful one specifies the distance to an obstacle : range_msg_right.range = tmp/100; We can then publish that information about the distance (you can again refer to the Arduino Publisher Tutorial for the publishing part) : pub_range4.publish(&range_msg_right); Here is the whole code for four ultrasound sensors based on the one presented in this link : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm3e-51ohgQ Moreover the code below is available in the Github repo of Ecam Eurobot : https://github.com/Ecam-Eurobot/Eurobot-2018/blob/ultrasound/arduino/sonar.ino You can find the tutorial in the Software chapter, ROS and Arduino part to test if you succesfully receive information from the sonar with rosserial. #include <ros.h>\n#include <sensor_msgs/Range.h>\n#include <NewPing.h> #define TRIGGER_PINR 5 //back\n#define ECHO_PINR 4 #define TRIGGER_PINL 7 //front\n#define ECHO_PINL 6 #define TRIGGER_PINB 12 //left\n#define ECHO_PINB 13 #define TRIGGER_PINF 11 //right\n#define ECHO_PINF 10 #define MAX_DISTANCE 300 // Maximum distance we want to ping NewPing sonarL(TRIGGER_PINL, ECHO_PINL, MAX_DISTANCE); // back us NewPing sonarR(TRIGGER_PINR, ECHO_PINR, MAX_DISTANCE); // front us\nNewPing sonarB(TRIGGER_PINB, ECHO_PINB, MAX_DISTANCE); // left us\nNewPing sonarF(TRIGGER_PINF, ECHO_PINF, MAX_DISTANCE); // right us ros::NodeHandle nh; sensor_msgs::Range range_msg_rear;\nsensor_msgs::Range range_msg_front;\nsensor_msgs::Range range_msg_left;\nsensor_msgs::Range range_msg_right;\nros::Publisher pub_range1(\"ultrasound_rear\", &range_msg_rear);\nros::Publisher pub_range2(\"ultrasound_front\", &range_msg_front);\nros::Publisher pub_range3(\"ultrasound_left\", &range_msg_left);\nros::Publisher pub_range4(\"ultrasound_right\", &range_msg_right); char frameid[] = \"base_link\"; long duration; float tmp; void setup()\n{ nh.initNode(); nh.advertise(pub_range1); nh.advertise(pub_range2); nh.advertise(pub_range3); nh.advertise(pub_range4); range_msg_rear.radiation_type = sensor_msgs::Range::ULTRASOUND; range_msg_rear.header.frame_id = \"ultrasound_rear\"; range_msg_rear.field_of_view = 0.3665; // fake range_msg_rear.min_range = 0.0; range_msg_rear.max_range = MAX_DISTANCE; range_msg_front.radiation_type = sensor_msgs::Range::ULTRASOUND; range_msg_front.header.frame_id = \"ultrasound_front\"; range_msg_front.field_of_view = 0.3665; // fake range_msg_front.min_range = 0.0; range_msg_front.max_range = MAX_DISTANCE; range_msg_left.radiation_type = sensor_msgs::Range::ULTRASOUND; range_msg_left.header.frame_id = \"ultrasound_front\"; range_msg_left.field_of_view = 0.3665; // fake range_msg_left.min_range = 0.0; range_msg_left.max_range = MAX_DISTANCE; range_msg_right.radiation_type = sensor_msgs::Range::ULTRASOUND; range_msg_right.header.frame_id = \"ultrasound_right\"; range_msg_right.field_of_view = 0.3665; // fake range_msg_right.min_range = 0.0; range_msg_right.max_range = MAX_DISTANCE;\n} long range_time; void loop()\n{ //publish the adc value every 50 milliseconds //since it takes that long for the sensor to stabilize if ( millis() >= range_time ){ tmp=sonarL.ping_cm(); range_msg_rear.range = tmp/100; range_msg_rear.header.stamp = nh.now(); pub_range1.publish(&range_msg_rear); tmp=sonarR.ping_cm(); range_msg_front.range = tmp/100; range_msg_front.header.stamp = nh.now(); pub_range2.publish(&range_msg_front); tmp=sonarB.ping_cm(); range_msg_left.range = tmp/100; range_msg_left.header.stamp = nh.now(); pub_range2.publish(&range_msg_left); tmp=sonarF.ping_cm(); range_msg_right.range = tmp/100; range_msg_right.header.stamp = nh.now(); pub_range4.publish(&range_msg_right); range_time = millis() + 50; } nh.spinOnce();\n}"},"software/ros/basics/sub.html#subscriber-node":{"breadcrumbs":"Software » ROS » Basic concepts » Subscriber Node","id":"software/ros/basics/sub.html#subscriber-node","title":"Subscriber Node","body":"In this chapter we'll create our first listener node, which will retrieve info from another publishing node.

Two registers must be modified to activate this mode : // turn on SPI in slave mode\nSPCR |= _BV(SPE);\n// turn on interrupts\nSPCR |= _BV(SPIE); So that these manipulations are transparent for the user we also create an object for the SPI bus slaves : SPISlave this object has several methods : begin() : change the two registers cited above and declaring the MISO pin as an output. reset() : reset private object variables. com() : manage the communication by putting the incoming data in the right variables. and some properties : command : return the register address. dataSize : return the size of the incoming message. msg : return the message (maximum 64 bits). endtrans : boolean that returns true if communication is complete. 1. Initialisation of the SPI communication The MOSI, MISO and SLK pin are always the same on arduino. If you want you can change the SS pin number we agree to use pin 10 as pin SS for the slave. Note : SS is a reserved name used for the SPI communication. On the begin of our script we create a SPI object and define the SS pin number as it's done in the following code : SpiSlave mySPI; //SLK : pin 13\n//MISO : pin 12\n//MOSI : pin 11 #define SS 10 to enable the communication, use the begin() method of the SPISlave object in the setup() function of the atemega : void setup()\n{ mySPI.begin();\n} 2. Interruption An incoming call performed by the master to the slave triggers an interrupt. In most cases, the method in which the interrupt routine will be placed will be: ISR (name _of _a _register) . in our case the register will be SPI _VTC _vect . As we work whith an atemega328p the shift register is called : SPDR . This way of working is illustrated in the following code : //Interrupt needed by SPI Communication\nISR (SPI_STC_vect) { //manage the communication by putting the incoming data in the right variables. mySPI.com(SPDR); //Method containing the registers of the Slave. spiReg(); } 3. Registers A SWITCH is commonly used to define the registers. In our case of use, it is the command property of the SPISlave object which is used as parameter of the SWITCH . the writing in a register will be done once the communication is finished (thanks to the property endTrans ). This method of work has the advantage of not having inconsistent values during the communication. The reading of a registers uses the full-duplex channel provided by the SPI. The data are pushed through the channel during the communication using the SPDR register. Here is an example of a function that contains the registers of a slave: void spiReg(){ switch (mySPI.command) { case 0x10: if(mySPI.endTrans) { for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++){ motor_speed.b[i] = mySPI.msg[i]; } } break; case 0x11: SPDR = motor_speed.b[mySPI.dataCount - 2]; break; case 0x50: motor_encoder.write(0); break; case 0x51: SPDR = EncoderState.b[mySPI.dataCount - 2]; break; } }","id":"electronics/communication/spi.html#our-slaves","title":"Our Slaves","breadcrumbs":"Electronics » Communication » Our Slaves"},"electronics/communication/can.html#usefull-links":{"breadcrumbs":"Electronics » Communication » Usefull links","body":"Introduction to CANBus by Texas Instrument, http://www.ti.com/lit/an/sloa101b/sloa101b.pdf CAN specs by BOSCH, https://www.kvaser.com/software/7330130980914/V1/can2spec.pdf CANBus implementation with Arduino, http://www.prometec.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Controller-Area-Network-Prototyping-With-Arduino-Wilfried-Voss.pdf Well documented on Wikipedia, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAN_bus","id":"electronics/communication/can.html#usefull-links","title":"Usefull links"},"electronics/fpga.html#fpga":{"breadcrumbs":"Electronics » FPGA","id":"electronics/fpga.html#fpga","title":"FPGA","body":""},"mechanical/2018/balls.html#ball-gun":{"body":"alt text","id":"mechanical/2018/balls.html#ball-gun","breadcrumbs":"Mechanical » 2018 specifics » Ball Gun","title":"Ball Gun"},"software/ros/basics/params.html#accessing-parameters-from-nodes":{"id":"software/ros/basics/params.html#accessing-parameters-from-nodes","title":"Accessing parameters from nodes","breadcrumbs":"Software » ROS » Basic concepts » Accessing parameters from nodes","body":"It is often the case that your nodes will have to access the parameter server during start up to retrieve configuration information, or set a parameter value.

First we made the fixed ramp that comes from the ball sorting mecanism and end around the wheel. alt text After that we made a straight ramp that shows the ball the direction it must take. alt text And finaly, we designed a small piece that maintain the straight ramp from below and that you can adjust. alt text After that, all we had to do is to install the gun in the robot and make some tests to determine the best power to give as a PWM to the motor to throw the balls from the distance chosen in the tank and to incorporate the code of the ball gun in the main code of the robot.","breadcrumbs":"Mechanical » 2018 specifics » Construction step by step"},"graphic/graphic_chart.html#graphic-chart":{"body":"alt text","breadcrumbs":"Graphic
