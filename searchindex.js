For the «Cortex» robot we used four sensors, one on each side so that’s what the final code presented at the end of this tutorial is based on. Firstly, in this code we are going to include the same libraries as shown in the Arduino Publisher Tutorial so you can refer to that part for the explanations. An additional useful library used for the sensors is the NewPing.h. So here are all the necessary libraries : #include <ros.h>\n#include <sensor_msgs/Range.h>\n#include <NewPing.h> Then you have to define the pins for each sensor. In this case, the ultrasound sensor has two pins (Trigger ans Echo). Here is an exemple with the sensor located on the right of the robot: #define TRIGGER_PINR 5\n#define ECHO_PINR 4 You also have to specify the maximum distance at which you want the sensor to still be able to detect : #define MAX_DISTANCE 300 Now as we are using the NewPing library you can simply create an ultrasound sensor object by doing this : NewPing sonarR(TRIGGER_PINR, ECHO_PINR, MAX_DISTANCE); where you specify the pins and the maximum distance defined previously. Moreover as mentioned in the Arduino Publisher Tutorial you specify the type of the ultrasound message and the name you want to assign to it : sensor_msgs::Range range_msg_right; You also have to add the following line which has also been explained in the Arduino Publisher Tutorial : ros::Publisher pub_range4(\"ultrasound_right\", &range_msg_right); We then have to fill each sonar object with the initialisation information associated : range_msg_right.radiation_type = sensor_msgs::Range::ULTRASOUND;\nrange_msg_right.header.frame_id = \"ultrasound_right\";\nrange_msg_right.field_of_view = 0.3665; // fake\nrange_msg_right.min_range = 0.0;\nrange_msg_right.max_range = MAX_DISTANCE; Now we can add parts to the void loop of the Arduino code. The most important and useful one specifies the distance to an obstacle : range_msg_right.range = tmp/100; We can then publish that information about the distance (you can again refer to the Arduino Publisher Tutorial for the publishing part) : pub_range4.publish(&range_msg_right); Here is the whole code for four ultrasound sensors based on the one presented in this link : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm3e-51ohgQ Moreover the code below is available in the Github repo of Ecam Eurobot : https://github.com/Ecam-Eurobot/Eurobot-2018/blob/ultrasound/arduino/sonar.ino You can find the tutorial in the Software chapter, ROS and Arduino part to test if you succesfully receive information from the sonar with rosserial. #include <ros.h>\n#include <sensor_msgs/Range.h>\n#include <NewPing.h> #define TRIGGER_PINR 5 //back\n#define ECHO_PINR 4 #define TRIGGER_PINL 7 //front\n#define ECHO_PINL 6 #define TRIGGER_PINB 12 //left\n#define ECHO_PINB 13 #define TRIGGER_PINF 11 //right\n#define ECHO_PINF 10 #define MAX_DISTANCE 300 // Maximum distance we want to ping NewPing sonarL(TRIGGER_PINL, ECHO_PINL, MAX_DISTANCE); // back us NewPing sonarR(TRIGGER_PINR, ECHO_PINR, MAX_DISTANCE); // front us\nNewPing sonarB(TRIGGER_PINB, ECHO_PINB, MAX_DISTANCE); // left us\nNewPing sonarF(TRIGGER_PINF, ECHO_PINF, MAX_DISTANCE); // right us ros::NodeHandle nh; sensor_msgs::Range range_msg_rear;\nsensor_msgs::Range range_msg_front;\nsensor_msgs::Range range_msg_left;\nsensor_msgs::Range range_msg_right;\nros::Publisher pub_range1(\"ultrasound_rear\", &range_msg_rear);\nros::Publisher pub_range2(\"ultrasound_front\", &range_msg_front);\nros::Publisher pub_range3(\"ultrasound_left\", &range_msg_left);\nros::Publisher pub_range4(\"ultrasound_right\", &range_msg_right); char frameid[] = \"base_link\"; long duration; float tmp; void setup()\n{ nh.initNode(); nh.advertise(pub_range1); nh.advertise(pub_range2); nh.advertise(pub_range3); nh.advertise(pub_range4); range_msg_rear.radiation_type = sensor_msgs::Range::ULTRASOUND; range_msg_rear.header.frame_id = \"ultrasound_rear\"; range_msg_rear.field_of_view = 0.3665; // fake range_msg_rear.min_range = 0.0; range_msg_rear.max_range = MAX_DISTANCE; range_msg_front.radiation_type = sensor_msgs::Range::ULTRASOUND; range_msg_front.header.frame_id = \"ultrasound_front\"; range_msg_front.field_of_view = 0.3665; // fake range_msg_front.min_range = 0.0; range_msg_front.max_range = MAX_DISTANCE; range_msg_left.radiation_type = sensor_msgs::Range::ULTRASOUND; range_msg_left.header.frame_id = \"ultrasound_front\"; range_msg_left.field_of_view = 0.3665; // fake range_msg_left.min_range = 0.0; range_msg_left.max_range = MAX_DISTANCE; range_msg_right.radiation_type = sensor_msgs::Range::ULTRASOUND; range_msg_right.header.frame_id = \"ultrasound_right\"; range_msg_right.field_of_view = 0.3665; // fake range_msg_right.min_range = 0.0; range_msg_right.max_range = MAX_DISTANCE;\n} long range_time; void loop()\n{ //publish the adc value every 50 milliseconds //since it takes that long for the sensor to stabilize if ( millis() >= range_time ){ tmp=sonarL.ping_cm(); range_msg_rear.range = tmp/100; range_msg_rear.header.stamp = nh.now(); pub_range1.publish(&range_msg_rear); tmp=sonarR.ping_cm(); range_msg_front.range = tmp/100; range_msg_front.header.stamp = nh.now(); pub_range2.publish(&range_msg_front); tmp=sonarB.ping_cm(); range_msg_left.range = tmp/100; range_msg_left.header.stamp = nh.now(); pub_range2.publish(&range_msg_left); tmp=sonarF.ping_cm(); range_msg_right.range = tmp/100; range_msg_right.header.stamp = nh.now(); pub_range4.publish(&range_msg_right); range_time = millis() + 50; } nh.spinOnce();\n}","breadcrumbs":"Electronics » Sensors » Arduino ROS code"},"organization/mdbook.html#images":{"id":"organization/mdbook.html#images","breadcrumbs":"Organization » Images","title":"Images","body":"In mdBook, paths to images should always be referenced from the src folder.

The reason why we use a ATmega328 alone is the size of the system. The microcontroller and its oscillator are sufficient for our application and take less place on the robot. However, in this tutorial, we will use the arduino UNO to slightly simplify manipulation. Regarding the regulation, the following code implements the PID regulator. Its parameters were found after experimentation. It depends of the motor and the load. We simply adjusted the parameters until the motor behaviour was the expected one. (mr. Marchand knows the methodology ;) ) The blocks of the system are described below : Encoder The encoder sends the rotation information to the controller. In our code, we used the Encoder.h library to handle it. At this moment, we have the velocity of the wheel in rad/s. Motor control The H bridge is used for power two motors at the same. One the left side of the board there are all control pins (PWM and DIR for the two motors) and power supply of command (5V).

The implemented PID regulator computes the necessary duty cycle to send for reaching the target velocity function of its parameters. The following complete circuit is shown below --- PIC OF THE CIRCUIT --- UNO + H Bridge + MOTOR - DRAW CONNECTION --- After robot's deconstruction The implemented PID regulator computes to reach the target velocity So at this moment, you have an arduino UNO controlling motor in velocity thanks to a PID regulation. All regulation is visible in the Serial Window of the Arduino software. Now the next step is to give the control of the motor velocity to ROS core on the raspberry. For that, we implemented a SPI connection with ROS. These concepts are explained in the ROS serial section. On the motor side, a function is added on the main code on the arduino UNO to receive data from master and set value of PID (proportional gain, integrative gain, derivative gain and velocity setpoints. // function that executes whenever data is received from the master\n// this function is registered as an event, see setup()\nvoid receiveEvent(int howMany) { if (Wire.available() >= 2) { unsigned char reg = Wire.read(); switch (reg) { // Configuration case 0x00: Serial.println(\"Tried to change the configuration, but it's not handled yet...\"); break; // Set motor speed case 0x10: // Expecting a 4 byte float value representing // angular velocity if (Wire.available() >= 4) { unsigned char b0 = Wire.read(); unsigned char b1 = Wire.read(); unsigned char b2 = Wire.read(); unsigned char b3 = Wire.read(); motor_speed = bytesToFloat(b0, b1, b2, b3); Serial.print(\"Motor speed set to \"); Serial.print(motor_speed, 3); Serial.println(\" rad/s\"); } break; // Set PID gains case 0x20: // Expecting a 4 byte float value representing // proportional gain for the PID if (Wire.available() >= 4) { unsigned char b0 = Wire.read(); unsigned char b1 = Wire.read(); unsigned char b2 = Wire.read(); unsigned char b3 = Wire.read(); gain_p = bytesToFloat(b0, b1, b2, b3); Serial.print(\"Proportional gain set to \"); Serial.println(gain_p, 3); } break; case 0x21: // Expecting a 4 byte float value representing // integral gain for the PID if (Wire.available() >= 4) { unsigned char b0 = Wire.read(); unsigned char b1 = Wire.read(); unsigned char b2 = Wire.read(); unsigned char b3 = Wire.read(); gain_i = bytesToFloat(b0, b1, b2, b3); Serial.print(\"Integral gain set to \"); Serial.println(gain_i, 3); } break; case 0x22: // Expecting a 4 byte float value representing // derivative gain for the PID if (Wire.available() >= 4) { unsigned char b0 = Wire.read(); unsigned char b1 = Wire.read(); unsigned char b2 = Wire.read(); unsigned char b3 = Wire.read(); gain_d = bytesToFloat(b0, b1, b2, b3); Serial.print(\"Derivative gain set to \"); Serial.println(gain_d, 3); } break; default: Serial.println(\"Unexcpected register access over I2C\"); break; } }\n}"},"electronics/sensors/sonar.html#tutorial":{"body":"","title":"Tutorial","id":"electronics/sensors/sonar.html#tutorial","breadcrumbs":"Electronics » Sensors » Tutorial"},"electronics/fpga.html#a53-operation":{"id":"electronics/fpga.html#a53-operation","body":"The main data object is an 8-bit register called DATA.

Once the photo has been taken, the camera automatically switches off and we connect to the robot by wifi (a Raspberry connected with the same Wi-Fi for future image treatment). During this treatment, we use the OpenCV free graphics library. We have drawn three frames on the picture (one for each cube to detect) to delimit the test portion. The board analyzes all pixels within each frame to obtain the color. However, we have implemented in our program the different possible combinations to save time. Indeed, we only required two colors to deduce the final combination.

We also need to avoid transferring data from a flip-flop driven by one clock to a flip-flop driven by another clock.

The first flip-flop creates a synchronous version of the inputs by clocking it with the system clock. The input signal could change within the flip-flop’s setup and hold times and may take longer than a system clock cycle to settle to a stable value (metastability). That’s why it is ran through a second flip-flop. The second flip-flop, makes it is very unlikely that this metastability propagates to the output.

That event triggers the lift and thus the block starts to raise up. Therefore we are using another DC motor with a belt as you can see on the picture below. img Thanks to the colour detection we know in which order we have to collect the blocks on the field, so we also know which one comes first in the lift and which floor it has to go to. It is important to know the specific floor in order to create the pattern showed at the beginning of the game and recognised by the colour and sequence recognition part. To know when the lift has to stop, we use the encoder of the DC motor so we can precisely know when the motor has to stop. The encoder is connected to an interruption pin on the Arduino board so the tick counts can be more accurate and have priority. Once the block is on the right floor, it has to be pushed outside of the lift to already be placed in its position on the tower on a kind of shelf (as you can see in the picture below) which supports the blocks even if there is no other block below. img Furthermore, to push the block, we use a dynamixel with a gear and a tooth rack to slide a plate along which pushes the block until it reaches the « shelf ». img Then the lift (without any block inside) goes down. To make sure it doesn’t go too much we use another limit switch. Therefore the lift is immediately stopped, another cube comes in and we can do the cube lifting steps mentioned before over again until all the cubes of the tower are placed. As mentioned above, we are using DC motors to control our lift. We have in all 3 motors and they are all connected to a L298 driver (see picture below) controlled by an Arduino Uno board. Here is a link where you can buy the driver : https://www.amazon.fr/L298-Motor-Driver/s?ie=UTF8&page=1&rh=i%3Aaps%2Ck%3AL298%20Motor%20Driver img We use 2 motors for the rollers to collect the blocks. In order to do so, each one has to turn in the opposite direction of the other but at the same speed. Thus we connected them to the same driver but inverted the pins of one motor compared to the other one. These motors don’t have an encoder so their only 2 pins are connected to the driver. We also have the third motor to make the lift go up and down. As we said before, we use the encoder to know where we have to stop so there are pins of the motor connected to the Arduino board.

So when the subscriber receives the message, it doesn’t react depending on its content but it only reacts because a message has been sent.

The connection and media between the devices indicates the physical layer. Data link layer defines the way in which the devices are connected. The connections include the input and output lines such as clock, data in and data out. Data link layer in SPI is implied in the connection itself and no provision is made for location or address information. The communiction frame is writen for the use (Layer three on OSI Model). To begin a communication with a Slave , the Master must fix the Slave Select pin (SS) to LOW state. After that, the master can put some bits into the shift register throught the MOSI (Master Output Slave Input) pin. When the communication is done, it's the master who must put back the SS to HIGH State.

To create a publisher : ros::Publisher chatter(\"chatter\", &msg); This tells that we are going to be publishing a message of the type of the msg variable (with std_msgs::String type) on the topic «chatter». This lets the master tell any nodes listening on «chatter» that we are going to publish data on that topic. You can now add lines in the void setup() of the Arduino script. You first initialize the node : nh.initNode() Next, the following call connects to the master to publicize that the node will be publishing messages on the given topic : nh.advertise(chatter); So finally this is what the void setup() in your Arduino code should look like : void setup()\n{ nh.initNode(); nh.advertise(chatter);\n} To fill the message object with the data you just have to do this : msg.data = hello; where hello is the data you put in your message and hello must have the same type as the msg variable. You can then publish you message on the topic. To do so you can either publish it once or continually in the void loop() of your Arduino code like this : void loop()\n{ chatter.publish( &str_msg );\n} Finally you have to add a last line of code in the loop that will call all the callbacks waiting to be called at that point in time : nh.spinOnce(); Now that you know how each part of the code works you can test a «Hello World» example available on the wiki.ros.org website http://wiki.ros.org/rosserial_arduino/Tutorials/Hello%20World : /* * rosserial Publisher Example * Prints \"hello world!\" */\n// Use the following line if you have a Leonardo or MKR1000 //#define USE_USBCON #include <ros.h>\n#include <std_msgs/String.h> ros::NodeHandle nh; std_msgs::String str_msg;\nros::Publisher chatter(\"chatter\", &str_msg); char hello[13] = \"hello world!\"; void setup()\n{ nh.initNode(); nh.advertise(chatter);\n} void loop()\n{ str_msg.data = hello; chatter.publish( &str_msg ); nh.spinOnce(); delay(1000);\n} You have to upload this code on the Arduino board before connecting it to the Raspberry and before starting the test on ROS.","breadcrumbs":"Software » ROS » ROS and Arduino » Publisher","title":"Publisher","id":"software/ros/arduino/publisher.html#publisher"},"mechanical/3d-print.html#a11-think-mechanical-properties":{"id":"mechanical/3d-print.html#a11-think-mechanical-properties","body":"When you'll have to create a mechanical piece for your robot, you have to think about the way you'll use it.

Two registers must be modified to activate this mode : // turn on SPI in slave mode\nSPCR |= _BV(SPE);\n// turn on interrupts\nSPCR |= _BV(SPIE); So that these manipulations are transparent for the user we also create an object for the SPI bus slaves : SPISlave this object has several methods : begin() : change the two registers cited above and declaring the MISO pin as an output. reset() : reset private object variables. com() : manage the communication by putting the incoming data in the right variables. and some properties : command : return the register address. dataSize : return the size of the incoming message. msg : return the message (maximum 64 bits). endtrans : boolean that returns true if communication is complete. 1. Initialisation of the SPI communication The MOSI, MISO and SLK pin are always the same on arduino. If you want you can change the SS pin number we agree to use pin 10 as pin SS for the slave. Note : SS is a reserved name used for the SPI communication. On the begin of our script we create a SPI object and define the SS pin number as it's done in the following code : SpiSlave mySPI; //SLK : pin 13\n//MISO : pin 12\n//MOSI : pin 11 #define SS 10 to enable the communication, use the begin() method of the SPISlave object in the setup() function of the atemega : void setup()\n{ mySPI.begin();\n} 2. Interruption An incoming call performed by the master to the slave triggers an interrupt. In most cases, the method in which the interrupt routine will be placed will be: ISR (name _of _a _register) . in our case the register will be SPI _VTC _vect . As we work whith an atemega328p the shift register is called : SPDR . This way of working is illustrated in the following code : //Interrupt needed by SPI Communication\nISR (SPI_STC_vect) { //manage the communication by putting the incoming data in the right variables. mySPI.com(SPDR); //Method containing the registers of the Slave. spiReg(); } 3. Registers A SWITCH is commonly used to define the registers. In our case of use, it is the command property of the SPISlave object which is used as parameter of the SWITCH . the writing in a register will be done once the communication is finished (thanks to the property endTrans ). This method of work has the advantage of not having inconsistent values during the communication. The reading of a registers uses the full-duplex channel provided by the SPI. The data are pushed through the channel during the communication using the SPDR register. Here is an example of a function that contains the registers of a slave: void spiReg(){ switch (mySPI.command) { case 0x10: if(mySPI.endTrans) { for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++){ motor_speed.b[i] = mySPI.msg[i]; } } break; case 0x11: SPDR = motor_speed.b[mySPI.dataCount - 2]; break; case 0x50: motor_encoder.write(0); break; case 0x51: SPDR = EncoderState.b[mySPI.dataCount - 2]; break; } }","breadcrumbs":"Electronics » Communication » Our Slaves","title":"Our Slaves","id":"electronics/communication/spi.html#our-slaves"},"electronics/communication/can.html#the-frame":{"breadcrumbs":"Electronics » Communication » The frame","body":"alt text A data frame is made of different parts : 1 dominant bit begins the frame The ID of the message is made of 11 bits in the standart CAN or 29 bits in the extended CAN. 6 bits which determine the lenght of the frame The data made of 0...8 bytes 15 bits of CRC to detect errors ACK End of frame bit","title":"The frame","id":"electronics/communication/can.html#the-frame"},"software/ros/advanced/custom-msgs.html#custom-messages":{"breadcrumbs":"Software » ROS » Advanced concepts » Custom messages","id":"software/ros/advanced/custom-msgs.html#custom-messages","body":"","title":"Custom messages"},"software/ros/basics/packages.html#rosrun":{"id":"software/ros/basics/packages.html#rosrun","title":"rosrun","breadcrumbs":"Software » ROS » Basic concepts » rosrun","body":"To run a package, we use the rosrun command executed like this: rosrun PACKAGE EXECUTABLE [ARGS] PACKAGE is the name of the created package, for example my_awesome_code , and EXECUTABLE is the name of the python file containing the code.

That was OK, because we didn’t care about such output glitches caused by the input signals propagating to the outputs. From a demonstrator’s point of view it even made it more interesting. Talking to a real device, such as a SPI master is different, because it requires the outputs to be stable at certain times. z The solution is to introduce a clock signal, and store the signals in a flip-flop (registers) at the rising edge of that clock signal.

So I first made a prototype of the ball gun made of wood and a small DC motor I found in the lab but for the first tests it appeared that the small DC motor wasn't powerfull enough. So I choose a more powerfull and a better speed motor as a Maxon motor found in the lab and the results were very conclusive. alt text The next step was to control the speed of the wheel so we could control the distance the ball make after throwing by the ball gun. I used a small motor driver as the L293D which the specifications were in agreement with the needs of the DC motor. alt text alt text You can find the datasheet of the L293D here : https://github.com/Ecam-Eurobot/Tutorials/tree/StevenGaro-patch-1/src/mechanical/2018/BallGun_SRC To control the H bridge driver, I used a simple arduino uno with a PWM signal so we could test different speeds of the motor. alt text The precision of the distance the ball make was made experimentaly when we did the different tests. The code I first used to test the driver with the motor is the next code in arduino : int inputPin = A0; // set input pin for the potentiometer\nint inputValue = 0; // potentiometer input variable const int motorPin1 = 5; // Pin 14 of L293\nconst int motorPin2 = 6; // Pin 10 of L293 void setup() { // declare the ledPin as an OUTPUT: pinMode(motorPin1, OUTPUT); } void loop() { // read the value from the potentiometer: inputValue = analogRead(inputPin); // send the square wave signal to the LED: analogWrite(motorPin1, inputValue); digitalWrite(motorPin1, HIGH); delayMicroseconds(inputValue); // Approximately 10% duty cycle @ 1KHz digitalWrite(motorPin1, LOW); delayMicroseconds(1023 - inputValue); } When the tests were conclusive enough, we designed a ramp that fit in the robot correctly with an adjustable ramp for the ball to go higher or lower in case we need to modify the distance during the competition. First we made the fixed ramp that comes from the ball sorting mecanism and end around the wheel. alt text After that we made a straight ramp that shows the ball the direction it must take. alt text And finaly, we designed a small piece that maintain the straight ramp from below and that you can adjust. alt text After that, all we had to do is to install the gun in the robot and make some tests to determine the best power to give as a PWM to the motor to throw the balls from the distance chosen in the tank and to incorporate the code of the ball gun in the main code of the robot.","id":"mechanical/2018/balls.html#construction-step-by-step"},"software/ros/basics/params.html#parameters":{"breadcrumbs":"Software » ROS » Basic concepts » Parameters","body":"Parameters are named using the normal ROS naming convention.
