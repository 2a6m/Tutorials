ROS is commonly installed upon a Linux operating system. There are different ROS versions: Lunar (Latest) Kinetic (LTS) Jade Indigo ... The ROS distribution we're using for Eurobot is the 'Kinetic' versions. What's great about ROS, it's that there is an ever growing community that is sharing their code & projects of robotic machines. This is great because there are many build-in/downloadable libraries ready to use and the end user doesn't need to reinvent the wheel for classic robotic manipulations, like for example: Drivers to read/write to sensors Robotic algorithms (navigation, interpret sensor data, object manipulation) ...

Choose a directory for your workspace, let's use 'catkin_ws' mkdir -p ~/catkin_ws/src\ncd ~/catkin_ws/src\ncatkin_init_workspace This will create a CMakeLists.txt file in your /src folder.

You can see on the picture below the topology of this communictaion interface and the pinout of the components: To begin a communication with a Slave , the Master must fix the Slave Select pin (SS) to LOW state. After that, the master can put somme bit into the shift register throught the MOSI (Master Output Slave Input) pin. There isn't any standard communiction protocol but the communiction frame is often writen for the use. When the communication is done, it's the master who must put back the SS to HIGH State. Note : It's a full duplex interface, The slave can push some data on his MISO (Master Input Slave Output) pin during the communication. ###advantages Full duplex communication Flexibility of the number of bits to be transmitted as well as the protocol itself no possible collision ###disadvantage (3 + N*Slaves) pins are required on the master 4 pins are required on each slaves Master can speak in a vacuum without knowing it Bus can only count one master ##Use of our SPI the communication frame we used to send data to the slave is: Register adress on 8 bits Number of bytes composing the message Message Note : to read some data from a slave's register, the master must just send the register adress. The slave push the data on his MISO (Master Input Slave Output) pin. ###Our Master Create a SPI Master is really easy with a atmega328p and the arduino IDE. Indeed, we can find easily some libraries. We used the one provided directly by the arduino IDE in an object that we implemented : SPIManager how to work with SPIManager object will be illustrated at least code use for Cortex's engines control (Eurobot 2018) : MotorBroker #####1. Initialisation of the SPI communication The SPIManager object must be seen as a communication channel with the slave. It will be necessary to instantiate one SPIManager object by slave. When creating the object, use the number of the SS pin as an argument. //Define the SS pin for each slave\n#define FL_SS 9\n#define FR_SS 2\n#define BL_SS 10\n#define BR_SS 3 //Object Instantiation\nSPIManager connFL(FL_SS);\nSPIManager connFR(FR_SS);\nSPIManager connBL(BL_SS);\nSPIManager connBR(BR_SS); Use the initialize() method to activate the communication channel. This call should be placed in the setup() function of the arduino code. connFL.initialize(); #####2. Write data to a Slave's register as said above, to write a value in a register of the slave will first send the address of the register, then the size in number of byte and to finish, the message. The writedata function has been written to make its use as intuitive as possible. below, an example of use where we send to the register 16 (0x10), the message x.b whose size is 4 bytes . connBR.writeData(0x10, 0x04, x.b); #####3. Read data from a Slave's register There are two functions to read some data: the first, readLongData , will return a value of type long and the other , readData , a value of type float32 below, an example of use where we get some data from th register 81 (0x51). encoders_msg.rear_left = connBL.readLongData(0x51); from here the documentation is still being written ###Our Slaves When using the Arduino IDE to program atmeg328p, the slave mode is not available. Two registers must be modified to activate this mode : // turn on SPI in slave mode\nSPCR |= _BV(SPE);\n// turn on interrupts\nSPCR |= _BV(SPIE); So that these manipulations are transparent for the user we also create an object for the SPI bus slaves : SPISlave this object has several methods : begin() reset() com() and some properties : command dataSize msg endtrans #####1. Initialisation of the SPI communication SpiSlave mySPI;\n//SLK : pin 13\n//MISO : pin 12\n//MOSI : pin 11 #define SS 10 mySPI.begin(); #####2. Interruption //Interrupt needed by SPI Communication\nISR (SPI_STC_vect) { mySPI.com(SPDR); spiReg();//Function called at the end of the communication. } #####3. Registers void spiReg(){ switch (mySPI.command) { case 0x10: if(mySPI.endTrans) { for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++){ motor_speed.b[i] = mySPI.msg[i]; } } break; case 0x11: SPDR = motor_speed.b[mySPI.dataCount - 2]; break; case 0x50: motor_encoder.write(0); break; case 0x51: SPDR = EncoderState.b[mySPI.dataCount - 2]; break; } } ###Troubleshooting #####1.

Here, we have chosen a GoPro as a camera because it has an acceptable quality (780 pixel-HD) and it has also a Wi-Fi module for the remote control. Once the photo has been taken, the camera automatically switches off and we connect to the robot by wifi (a Raspberry connected with the same Wi-Fi for future image treatment). During this treatment, we use the OpenCV free graphics library. We have drawn three frames on the picture (one for each cube to detect) to delimit the test portion. The board analyzes all pixels within each frame: It looks whether the color detected is in the range color defined for every color (each color range is defined with one high and one low BGR value) After that, it returns a value: more the value is great, more the color lies within the range. The program adds up the values and the final value thus obtained determines the color within the range of colors determined initially. However, we have implemented in our program the different possible combinations to save time. Indeed, we only required two colors to deduce the final combination. As a matter of conclusion, we send combination to the robot by ROS. z Bill of materials: One Raspberry Pi zero W One Wi-Fi GoPro (Hero+) One 5V battery Etcher (https://etcher.io/) to install an OS on the Raspberry Connections No pins required Setup Download last version Ubuntu mate (16.04) or an another distribution for the raspberry (see install ) Active WiFi and open terminal ( alt+ctrl+t ): Install ROS (see install ) Import this repo from github Go to \"codes\" folder: cd src/codes/software/image-processing/tests Connect the GoPro or your webcam to the Raspberry For testing the camera, go to \"test camera\" folder : cd test_camera For GoPro: python3 go_pro_test.py Don't forget to connect the GoPro WiFi to the raspberry Pi ! For the webcam: python webcam_test.py Scripts Go to color_detection folder : cd ../test_color_detection Open GP_combination.sh : nano GP_combination.sh Change line3 with the name of your GoPro WiFi : nmcli c up \"your GoPro wifi\" Change line6 with the name of robot WiFi nmcli c up \"your wifi robot\" save it ( ctrl+x ) Run this script on the terminal : bash GP_combination.sh If you use the webcam : bash WB_combination.sh You'll see 3 colors frames on the picture and the final combination color on the terminal) Adjust position of a frame Maintain your cursor where you want to place a side of the frame. Take note of the position. Open a new tab ( ctrl+shift+t ) Change the position in the code : nano color_detection.py before Note : xmin is the left side of the square, xmax is the right side of the square, ymin is the top side of the square and ymax is the bottom side of the square. Restart for another side of the frame and save the file ( ctrl+x ) after Adjust range color Maintain your cursor in the center of the cube Take note of the RGB color Open a new tab ( ctrl+shift+t ) Change the color range in the code (color_detection.py) and save the file ( ctrl+x ) z ROS You use ROS to send the color combination to another robot module : Open terminal and launch ROS : . ~/eurobot_ws/devel/setup.bash\nroslaunch image-processing test.launch Open a new tab ( ctrl+shift+t ) and display messages published to a topic : rostopic echo /color_seq Don't forget to change frames positions and color ranges !","id":"software/image-processing.html#image-treatment-module","breadcrumbs":"Software » Image treatment module","title":"Image treatment module"},"mechanical/mecanum.html#forward-kinematics":{"id":"mechanical/mecanum.html#forward-kinematics","breadcrumbs":"Mechanical » Forward kinematics","title":"Forward kinematics","body":"The forward kinematic equations allow us to compute the robot's base velocity when given the individual wheel velocities.
