You can see on the picture below the topology of this communictaion interface and the pinout of the components: To begin a communication with a Slave , the Master must fix the Slave Select pin (SS) to LOW state. After that, the master can put somme bit into the shift register throught the MOSI (Master Output Slave Input) pin. There isn't any standard communiction protocol but the communiction frame is often writen for the use. When the communication is done, it's the master who must put back the SS to HIGH State. Note : It's a full duplex interface, The slave can push some data on his MISO (Master Input Slave Output) pin during the communication. ###advantages Full duplex communication Flexibility of the number of bits to be transmitted as well as the protocol itself no possible collision ###disadvantage (3 + N*Slaves) pins are required on the master 4 pins are required on each slaves Master can speak in a vacuum without knowing it Bus can only count one master ##Use of our SPI the communication frame we used to send data to the slave is: Register adress on 8 bits Number of bytes composing the message Message Note : to read some data from a slave's register, the master must just send the register adress. The slave push the data on his MISO (Master Input Slave Output) pin. ###Our Master Create a SPI Master is really easy with a atmega328p and the arduino IDE. Indeed, we can find easily some libraries. We used the one provided directly by the arduino IDE in an object that we implemented : SPIManager how to work with SPIManager object will be illustrated at least code use for Cortex's engines control (Eurobot 2018) : MotorBroker #####1. Initialisation of the SPI communication The SPIManager object must be seen as a communication channel with the slave. It will be necessary to instantiate one SPIManager object by slave. When creating the object, use the number of the SS pin as an argument. //Define the SS pin for each slave\n#define FL_SS 9\n#define FR_SS 2\n#define BL_SS 10\n#define BR_SS 3 //Object Instantiation\nSPIManager connFL(FL_SS);\nSPIManager connFR(FR_SS);\nSPIManager connBL(BL_SS);\nSPIManager connBR(BR_SS); Use the initialize() method to activate the communication channel. This call should be placed in the setup() function of the arduino code. connFL.initialize(); #####2. Write data to a Slave's register as said above, to write a value in a register of the slave will first send the address of the register, then the size in number of byte and to finish, the message. The writedata function has been written to make its use as intuitive as possible. below, an example of use where we send to the register 16 (0x10), the message x.b whose size is 4 bytes . connBR.writeData(0x10, 0x04, x.b); #####3. Read data from a Slave's register There are two functions to read some data: the first, readLongData , will return a value of type long and the other , readData , a value of type float32 below, an example of use where we get some data from th register 81 (0x51). encoders_msg.rear_left = connBL.readLongData(0x51); from here the documentation is still being written ###Our Slaves When using the Arduino IDE to program atmeg328p, the slave mode is not available. Two registers must be modified to activate this mode : // turn on SPI in slave mode\nSPCR |= _BV(SPE);\n// turn on interrupts\nSPCR |= _BV(SPIE); So that these manipulations are transparent for the user we also create an object for the SPI bus slaves : SPISlave this object has several methods : begin() reset() com() and some properties : command dataSize msg endtrans #####1. Initialisation of the SPI communication SpiSlave mySPI;\n//SLK : pin 13\n//MISO : pin 12\n//MOSI : pin 11 #define SS 10 mySPI.begin(); #####2. Interruption //Interrupt needed by SPI Communication\nISR (SPI_STC_vect) { mySPI.com(SPDR); spiReg();//Function called at the end of the communication. } #####3. Registers void spiReg(){ switch (mySPI.command) { case 0x10: if(mySPI.endTrans) { for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++){ motor_speed.b[i] = mySPI.msg[i]; } } break; case 0x11: SPDR = motor_speed.b[mySPI.dataCount - 2]; break; case 0x50: motor_encoder.write(0); break; case 0x51: SPDR = EncoderState.b[mySPI.dataCount - 2]; break; } } ###Troubleshooting #####1. Problem between serial port (ROSSERIAL) and SPI bus #####2. sometimes the slave update the value of a register with the value received previously #####3. Changing the values of a register when reading another register https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_Peripheral_Interface_Bus"},"electronics/communication/can.html#hardware":{"body":"alt text The last figure shows the implementation of the CANBus. The implementation is quite easy because of the modules proposed by Microchip. A node is made of a transceiver, a CAN controller and a microcontroller. Transceiver Microchip proposes a lot of solutions for the automotive including a transceiver. It is the MCP2562. Formerly the MCP2551, is used to convert the TTL signal to a differential signal required by the CANBus. Controller Microchip also proposes the CAN controller MCP2515 which implements all the CAN 2.0 specifications. It is able to send and receive data and communicate it via SPI to a microcontroller. Microcontroller. Any microcontroller with an integrated SPI communication can be selected. For example we can take the famous ATMEGA328p known for his arduino IDE. Resistance In every communication wire there is some reflexion that can corrupt the data. It can be avoided by using 120 Ohm resistor at the end of line.

Here, we have chosen a GoPro as a camera because it has an acceptable quality (780 pixel-HD) and it has also a Wi-Fi module for the remote control. Once the photo has been taken, the camera automatically switches off and we connect to the robot by wifi (a Raspberry connected with the same Wi-Fi for future image treatment). During this treatment, we use the OpenCV free graphics library. We have drawn three frames on the picture (one for each cube to detect) to delimit the test portion. The board analyzes all pixels within each frame: It looks whether the color detected is in the range color defined for every color (each color range is defined with one high and one low BGR value) After that, it returns a value: more the value is great, more the color lies within the range. The program adds up the values and the final value thus obtained determines the color within the range of colors determined initially. However, we have implemented in our program the different possible combinations to save time. Indeed, we only required two colors to deduce the final combination.
