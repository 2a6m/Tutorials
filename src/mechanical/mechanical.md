# Mechanical

As every year, a big part of conceiving the robot is designing the mechanical parts. The requirements change with the years, but as a big innovation in 2018, we suggest to keep the [Mecanum wheels](mechanical/mecanum.md) system. According to the rules, you'll have to realize diverse action in order to get points.

For example, in 2018, the actions were:
- Collecting blocs, lift them, sort them according to their color and build a tower with them.
- Collecting balls from a pipe,  sort them by color and evacuate them to a lower position and to a higher one.

You'll find more information about the designed mechanisms in the two dedicated chapters ([Lift](mechanical/2018/lift.md) & [Ball mechanism](mechanical/2018/balls.md)).

Before that, we want to introduce you to one of our main tools to design those mechanisms and build them. These are:
- [Fusion 360](mechanical/fusion.md), to design 3D models.
- [3D Printing](mechanical/3d-print.md), to make the pieces we designed or found on the internet.
