# Mechanical

As every year, **a big part of the conception** of the robot is the **mechanical one**. The specificity of each year contest may vary but, as a big innovation from the 2018's team, we suggest to keep the [Mecanum wheels](mechanical/mecanum.html) system. Following the rules, you'll find **diverse action to realize to get** some **points**.

For example, in 2018, the actions were:
- **Get some bloc** on the table, lift them, sort them according their color and build a tower with them
- **Get some balls** from a distributor, also sort them by color and evacuate them to a lower position and to a higher one.

You'll receive more info about the designed mechanisms in the two dedicated chapters ([Lift](mechanical/2018/lift.html) & [Ball mechanism](mechanical/2018/balls.html)).

Before that, we want to introduce you to one of **our main tools** to design those mechanisms and build them. Those are:
- [Fusion 360](mechanical/fusion.html), for the **3D conception**
- [3D Printing](mechanical/3d-print.html), to **make**, sometimes complex **pieces** to machine, or simply pieces **quickly** and **cheap**.
