# Mechanical

As every year, a big part of the conception of the robot is the mechanical one. The specificity of each year contest may vary but, as a big innovation from the 2018's team, we suggest to keep the [Mecanum wheels](mechanical/mecanum.md) system. Following the rules, you'll find diverse action to realize and get some point.

For example, in 2018, the actions were:
- Get some bloc, lift them, sort them according their color and build a tower with them
- Get some balls from a distributor, also sort them by color and evacuate them to a lower position and to a higher one.

You'll receive more info about the designed mechanisms in the two dedicated chapters ([Lift](mechanical/2018/lift.md) & [Ball mechanism](mechanical/2018/balls.md)).

Before that, we want to introduce you to one of our main tools to design those mechanisms and build them. Those are:
- [Fusion 360](mechanical/fusion.md), for the 3D conception
- [3D Printing](mechanical/3d-print.md), to make, sometimes complex pieces to machine, or simply pieces quickly and cheap.
