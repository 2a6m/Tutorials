# Getting in touch with Fusion360
Fusion360 is a 3D modeling software used by many professionals and hobbyists to create pieces. You can directly send your models to slicers in order to print them or export the 2D plans to build it your own. The following few chapters should give you a global overview of how Fusion360 works and what you can use it for. We'll try to orient our writing to learn your to design in order to print your models later and will end with some tips about the printing of your designs.

To complete your learning we strongly recommend you subscribe to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCo29kn3d9ziFUZGZ50VKvWA">Lars Christensen's Youtube channel</a>. He's a master in the use of Fusion360 and has very well made videos about every problem of question you might have.
