# 1. What printer to choose?
The offer in mater of 3D printers is enormous and can be confusing to an unexperimented printer. And even if you know what you are looking for, you can find the same looking printer for at least 10 different prices and brands. As a matter of fact a lot of companies copy the "big ones" and sale these copies a lot cheaper. These copies can be a very good investment for non-professional work and can save you quite a few euros.

A general advice is to read reviews and to try to choses a printer that a lot of people have. Isolated brands are often isolated for a very good reason (quality issues for example) and you'll struggle finding informations on settings, performances and things like parts to print to upgrade you printer.

The Anet company for example is very popular brand that sells versions of open source printers. The are close to the cheapest you can find, but have very decent quality and high liability. Hereby lots of people have one and you can find tones of parts on thingiverse to upgrade their models.

Other companies like FLSUN sale some of the same open source models (prusa i3) a like more expensive but are less reliable and upgrade parts are pretty difficult to find.

So what to chose ?

Well we are not going to give you a list of printers to buy of printers to buy or not to buy, but we'll try to give you guidelines to follow when comparing what the market offers.

## 2. Technologies
Men have developed different ways to 3D print stuff, each and every one of it with its own advantages. The cheapest and thus most used is the extrusion of molten plastic, but others like resin printing (where a laser hits a bath of liquid resin hardening it instantly) or metal printing (same idea as for resin but with a bath of metal powder), are starting to emerge. These however are really expensive (2 000$ up to hundreds of dollars for the machine only) for the moment and won't be discussed any further.

The rest of this document will so only speak about plastic extrusion printing.

## 3. Structure of the printer
You'll find two main types of structures: cartesian and delta.

Delta 3D printers were designed for speed, but they also have the distinction of a print bed that never moves, which may come in handy for certain print jobs. In the other hand, their speed comes with a certain weakness for details and a lack in precision.

Cartesian printers are better for details and easier to build and maintain, but slower.

## 4.Details
As you might expect, cheap printers (100€-400€) don't have the same accuracy as semi-professional ones that cost about 2000€ (Ultimakers for example). This can be scaring at first, but think about it this way: do you really need to print at a resolution of 20 microns (an aluminum sheet is about 16 microns )? For most of the prints you'll make a precision of 0,2mm and a little bit of sanding is more than enough. You can find more than decent printers for around 200€ (Anet a6) for medium bed sizes. Larger bed printers will cost about 300€ (Creality3D CR - 10). Note that these printers are DIY printers so you'll have to assemble them your own. This might take a few days, but is a piece of cake with the manual and will save you a few hundred euros.
