# 2018 Specifics

In 2018, the two big mechanical tasks were:

1. **Collect cubes** that are distributed at specific locations on the playing field. The collected blocks then need to be stacked
   to create a tower. For each story (level), a bigger amount of points were given. Additionally, if the tower contained
   the 3 cube s√©quence, revealed at the beginning of the match, additionnal points were earned.
2. **Collect foam ping-pong balls** from the dispensers. The robot first has to open the lock so that the balls can fall out
   of the dispenser. Then the robot had to sort the balls and, depending on their color, either shoot them into a "tower"
   or put them in another recipient.
