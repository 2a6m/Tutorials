# Install docker
To ease the development process, we recommend installing ROS inside a docker container instead of using a virtual machine. This comes with several advantages like ease of installation, having a common development environment and performance gains while compiling and running code on your computer.

It is important to note that the robot will not use docker and will run ROS packages natively. If you are an expert and know what you are doing, feel free to use your own method to develop ROS packages. Be it inside a virtual machine or a dedicated linux partition on your drive. Otherwise, just stick to the instructions below.

## Linux
The installation varies quite a bit depending on your distribution because the repositories are different for each distro.
For more information, visit [this link](https://docs.docker.com/install/#server) and choose your distribution. If your distribution is not listed, try looking at the documentation of your own distro.

## Windows
On windows, you can download and install [this executable](https://download.docker.com/win/stable/Docker%20for%20Windows%20Installer.exe)
Once the docker app is installed, run it and you should see the docker icon in your system tray. Always make sure the service is up and running before trying to do anything with it.

For more information, follow [this link](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/#install-docker-for-windows-desktop-app).
## macOS
Download and run [this image](https://download.docker.com/mac/stable/Docker.dmg). When asked, drag and drop the docker.app whale icon to the application folder. Once it is finished, simply start the docker service by running the docker app. You should see the docker icon in your system tray. Always make sure the service is up and running before trying to do anything with it.

# Download the ROS container
Once docker is properly installed and the service is running, we can download the ROS image.
To begin, open a terminal (docker cmd on windovs) and enter the following command: `docker pull ros`
This will start the download of the official ROS image from the docker hub.

# Run the container
When the installation is finished, run the container with the following command: `docker run -it ros`. This will create a new container based on the ROS image we just downloaded. You now have a functionning ROS environment.
To exit the container, use <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>d</kbd> or type `exit` in the terminal.

Now if we want to get back into the container we were just using, we can't use the same command as above as it will again create a new, base container as before and all our modifications would be lost.
Instead, open a new terminal on your computer and find the ID of the container we just closed by typing: `docker ps -a`. You should see something resembling the following:
```
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS                      PORTS               NAMES
4a56ee12d64e        ros                 "/ros_entrypoint.sh â€¦"   9 seconds ago       Exited (0) 2 seconds ago                        inspiring_nobel
```

Now let's first start by renaming this container to something easier:
`docker rename <container ID> robot`

Replace `\<container ID\>` with the ID from above (4a56ee12d64e in this case) and `robot` by any name you wish.

After that, we can start the container again in the background with:
`docker start robot`

And attach to it to get access to the command prompt inside with:
`docker attach robot`

# Additional notes
By default, there is only one bash session running in the container. Practically, this means that if you try to attach the same container in multiple terminals simultaneously, you won't be able to run separate commands in each.

To fix this -- and this will be needed to launch `roscore` in background before any other ROS command --  start a new bash session inside the container by typing the following in a new terminal:
`docker exec -it robot bash`

This will start a new bash session inside the already running container and attach to it automatically. If you exit this session, the container will keep running in the background. To stop the container, you will have to exit from the terminal where you started (or attached) to it. You can also stop a container with the command `docker stop robot.
