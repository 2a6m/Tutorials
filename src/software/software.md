# Software

The software is an important part of the Robot. It is often the one that is the most challenging
as to few people work on it. In this part, we are going to introduce you to the software stack of
our robots. We will present the different technologies we used and try to explain many of the concepts
related to them.

In 2018, we build the robots around **[ROS](http://www.ros.org/)**, which is a robotics framework facilitating
software development for robotics. ROS is not easy to start with, but once you get the hang of it, it 
greatly improves your productivity. In the [ROS](software/ros/ros.html) chapters, we will try to distill the most important
information in order to get you started quickly.
