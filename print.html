<p>This book contains learning ressources and tutorials about many of the technologies
we used for our participation(s) in the Eurobot contests.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.eurobot.org/">Eurobot contest</a> is an international amateur robotics contest.
The objective is to build an autonomous robot that needs to accomplish a given set of tasks, earning you points.</p>
<p>Through this book, we hope to be able to transfer the knowledge and experience we have acquired during our participation to
the team that will participate next year. Our hope is that over the years, this ressource will grow with each participation
to become a huge source of information for anyone that wants to participate in the contest.</p>

<a class="header" href="print.html#organization" id="organization"><h1>Organization</h1></a>
<p>When working in a team, it is crucial to have a good way to share files, code and ressources
with other members of the team. In this chapter, we explain what tools we used and how
we organized our workflow for a good cooperation.</p>
<p>To share code, we use <a href="https://github.com/Ecam-Eurobot">GitHub</a> and <a href="https://git-scm.com/"><code>git</code></a>,
we have a shared Fusion360 project to store our 3D models and we have a Google Drive / OneDrive to
store all other files.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#github" id="github"><h1>GitHub</h1></a>
<p><a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> is a hosting service for software projects that use <a href="https://git-scm.com/"><code>git</code></a> for version control.
GitHub allows us to upload software projects to the cloud in order to facilitate collaboration. You can control who can and can't
contribute to a project and provides tools like <a href="https://guides.github.com/features/issues/">bug tracking</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is important to note that GitHub and Git are very separate things.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Git</strong> is a version control system that allows to keep a history of changes made to source code files</li>
<li><strong>GitHub</strong> is a hosting service that allows to upload Git repositories to the cloud for easier collaboration and sharing</li>
</ul>

<a class="header" href="print.html#introduction-to-git-and-github" id="introduction-to-git-and-github"><h2>Introduction to Git and GitHub</h2></a>
<p>If you have never used Git or GitHub, we recommend that you get familiar with it. They are incredibly powerful tools.
GitHub has a <a href="https://guides.github.com/">series of simple tutorials</a> that you can follow to get the basics.
We particularily recommend to read at least:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/">Hello World</a> to learn how to create a repository on GitHub</li>
<li><a href="https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/">Understanding the GitHub Flow</a> to learn how to use GitHub's Web interface
to contribute to a project</li>
<li><a href="https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/">Git Handbook</a> to learn the basics of Git and how to do the same as
the tutorial above but using Git directly in the command line. Using the terminal may not seem intuitive, but once you
understand how it works, it will greatly improve your productivity.</li>
<li><a href="https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/">Forking Projects</a> to learn how to contribute to projects where you don't
have write permissions.</li>
</ul>
<a class="header" href="print.html#ecam-eurobot-organization" id="ecam-eurobot-organization"><h2>Ecam-Eurobot organization</h2></a>
<p>GitHub allows us to create <em>organizations</em> so that multiple users can easily contribute to multiple projects in the organization.
We created the <a href="https://github.com/Ecam-Eurobot">Ecam-Eurobot</a> organization to put all our code under.</p>
<p>You can for example find the <a href="https://github.com/Ecam-Eurobot/Eurobot-2018">2018 repository</a> containing the codes for the
2018 robots, or the source code for this book in the <a href="https://github.com/Ecam-Eurobot/Tutorials">Tutorials repository</a>.</p>
<p>We create a new repository for each year. This allows us to keep old members in the organization with write access to the
projects they made and welcome new members with write access to the repository they contribute to.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#administration" id="administration"><h1>Administration</h1></a>
<p>To add new members to the organization and configure their permissions, we need an
administrator. Each year an administrator is designed who preferably has experience with
Git and GitHub in order to help his peers and resolve any Git problems they may face.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This chapter is destined for the person who administrates the GitHub organization</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The administrators for past years were:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>2018</strong> <a href="https://github.com/azerupi">@azerupi</a> (Mathieu David)</li>
<li><strong>2017</strong> <a href="https://github.com/charlesvdv">@charlesvdv</a> (Charles Vandevoorde)</li>
</ul>
<p>You can contact them (most recent first preferably) if you are the chosen administrator for your team.
They will add you with the correct privileges.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#creating-a-new-repository" id="creating-a-new-repository"><h2>Creating a new repository</h2></a>
<p>As administrator, your task is to setup GitHub and the repositories so that everyone can work on the
project. The first thing you want to do is create a new repository for your year.</p>
<p>We do however recommend to base it off off the repository from previous year instead of starting from scratch.
As administrator, head over to the <a href="https://github.com/Ecam-Eurobot">organization's page</a> to create a new repository.</p>
<p><img src="img/organization/org.png" alt="org" /></p>
<p>Fill in the name with <code>Eurobot-xxxx</code> where <code>xxxx</code> represents the year. You can add a description if you want. Leave all
the rest blank because we are going to push the code of previous year in the newly created repository.</p>
<p><img src="img/organization/new-repo.png" alt="new repository" /></p>
<p>You will land on the following page</p>
<p><img src="img/organization/new-repo2.png" alt="new repository created" /></p>
<p>Let's push the repository from last year into the newly created repository.
On the command line, clone last years repository. In this case, I will clone <a href="https://github.com/Ecam-Eurobot/Eurobot-2018">Eurobot-2018</a></p>
<pre><code>git clone https://github.com/Ecam-Eurobot/Eurobot-2018.git
cd Eurobot-2018
</code></pre>
<p>Now you need to add the newly created repository as a remote. And verify that it was added correctly.</p>
<pre><code>git remote add next-year https://github.com/Ecam-Eurobot/Eurobot-2019.git
git remote -v
</code></pre>
<p>Push the repository into the newly created repository</p>
<pre><code>git push -u next-year master
</code></pre>
<p>If we refresh the GitHub page for the newly created repository, we can see something similar to below.
We can see (in the top left) that we are in the new repository and if we look at the <code>README</code> at the
bottom we can see that it contains the files from previous year. We can now start to work in the new
repository without affecting the old one.</p>
<p><img src="img/organization/new-repo3.png" alt="Repository pushed" /></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong><br />
Now that the new repository is created, you can remove your local clone of the repository from last year.
You will not need it anymore.</p>
</blockquote>
<a class="header" href="print.html#adding-teams" id="adding-teams"><h2>Adding teams</h2></a>
<p>Now that the repository is created, you need to add two <strong>teams</strong> to the Eurobot organization:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Eurobot &lt;year&gt;</strong>: this team will contain all the members participating this year. We will give this team the privileges to push to any branch <strong>except the master branch</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Eurobot &lt;year&gt; Reviewers</strong>: this team will be given more privileges. They will be able to review and accept <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/">pull requests</a>
to the master branch.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong><br />
The master branch should <strong>always</strong> be kept in a working state, this is the golden rule! As administrator, with help from the reviewers, it is your duty to make sure
that this rule is followed by everyone. The normal development process should be the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>For any new development a new branch is created by the member that develops it</li>
<li>He implements the new feature / behavior</li>
<li>When done, he creates a pull request against the master branch</li>
<li>At least one reviewer reads the changes, makes sure that the code meets the quality guidelines and aproves the changes</li>
<li>Only then can the code be merged into the master branch.</li>
</ol>
<p>Resist the urge of merging code that hasn't been reviewed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To create a new team, go to the GitHub organization: <a href="https://github.com/Ecam-Eurobot">Ecam-Eurobot</a> and go to the &quot;teams&quot; tab.</p>
<p><img src="img/organization/new-team-1.png" alt="teams" /></p>
<p>Then click the <strong>&quot;New team&quot;</strong> button, fill in the name as mentioned above and then click <strong>&quot;Create the team&quot;</strong>.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#give-them-correct-permissions" id="give-them-correct-permissions"><h3>Give them correct permissions</h3></a>
<p>Now that the teams are created, we need to give them the correct permissions. Go to the newly created repository, under <strong>&quot;Settings&quot;</strong>
go to the <strong>&quot;Collaborators &amp; Teams&quot;</strong> section.</p>
<p><img src="img/organization/new-team-2.png" alt="teams" /></p>
<p>Then add the teams you created with the <strong>write</strong> permissions, like below.</p>
<p><img src="img/organization/permissions-1.png" alt="permissions" /></p>
<p>Now go to the <strong>&quot;Branches&quot;</strong> section and add the master branch as a protected branch.</p>
<p><img src="img/organization/permissions-2.png" alt="protected branch" /></p>
<p>And configure the protections like in the image below:</p>
<p><img src="img/organization/permissions-3.png" alt="protected branch" /></p>
<p>This will prevent anyone from commiting to the master branch directly <strong>except</strong> the administrator and the reviewers, who need push access to accept pull requests.
Don't abuse these privileges, it is always better to have your code reviewed by others, even if you are a badass programmer!</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#invite-members" id="invite-members"><h2>Invite members</h2></a>
<p>Now that everything is setup, we still need to invite the people who will be participating with you this year and assign them to the correct teams.
To do this, go to the organization's page again under the <strong>&quot;People&quot;</strong> tab and click on <strong>&quot;Invite member&quot;</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="img/organization/members-1.png" alt="members" /></p>
<p>Type in their GitHub user name and invite them. In the invitation, you can already assign them to the correct teams.</p>
<p><img src="img/organization/members-2.png" alt="members" /></p>
<p>Once the invitation has been sent, the invited user can accept the invitation by visiting the
organization's page: <a href="https://github.com/Ecam-Eurobot">https://github.com/Ecam-Eurobot</a>.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#mdbook" id="mdbook"><h1>mdBook</h1></a>
<p>To generate this online documentation &quot;book&quot;, we use a tool called <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/mdBook">mdBook</a>.
This chapter will briefly introduce this tool in order for anyone to be able to contribute and improve this document.</p>
<p>The official documentation for mdBook can be found <a href="https://rust-lang-nursery.github.io/mdBook/">here</a></p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#structure-of-a-book" id="structure-of-a-book"><h2>Structure of a book</h2></a>
<p>A book has the following structure:</p>
<pre><code>book-test/
├── book.toml
├── book
└── src
    ├── chapter_1.md
    └── SUMMARY.md
</code></pre>
<p>The <strong><code>book.toml</code></strong> file contains the configuration options of the book.
In this file you can find the title, the authors, but also an option to enable math equation rendering, etc.
For a list of the options, refer to the official documentation. The <code>book.toml</code> file also represents the
root folder of the book. When we run mdBook, we need to either run it in that folder or point it to that folder.</p>
<p>In that same folder, you can find 2 folders: <code>src</code> and <code>book</code>. <code>src</code> contains the source files, written in <a href="http://commonmark.org/help/">markdown</a>.
When running the tool, it will take all the files in that directory and compile them into the book which is then stored in the <code>book</code> folder.</p>
<p>Finally, the most important file is the <code>SUMMARY.md</code> file. This file represents the table of content of the book, giving the hierarchy of all the
chapters and where to find their source files. The folliwing is an extract from this books summary file.</p>
<pre><code class="language-md"># Summary

[Introduction](introduction.md)
- [Organization](organization/organization.md)
    - [GitHub](organization/github.md)
        - [Administration](organization/gh-admin.md)
    - [mdBook](organization/mdbook.md)
- [Mechanical](mechanical/mechanical.md)
    - [3D modeling with Fusion360](mechanical/fusion.md)
    - [3D printing](mechanical/3d-print.md)
    - [Mecanum wheels](mechanical/mecanum.md)
</code></pre>
<p>We can see that it is simply a set of nested markdown lists containing links to the source files.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#markdown" id="markdown"><h2>Markdown</h2></a>
<p>The source files for the book are written in <a href="http://commonmark.org/">Markdown</a>, which is a very simple markup language.
You can <a href="http://commonmark.org/help/">learn the basics in '60 seconds'</a>.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#syntax-highlighting" id="syntax-highlighting"><h3>Syntax highlighting</h3></a>
<p>To insert code blocks with syntax heighlighting, use triple backticks followed by the language name / abreviation:</p>
<pre><code>```python
import sys

sys.exit(0)
```
</code></pre>
<p>This will generate the following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">import sys

sys.exit(0)
</code></pre>
<a class="header" href="print.html#images" id="images"><h3>Images</h3></a>
<p>In mdBook, paths to images should always be referenced from the <code>src</code> folder. So if you image is located in <code>src/img/my-image.png</code>,
you should use <code>![Some alt text](img/my-image.png)</code>.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#generating-the-book" id="generating-the-book"><h2>Generating the book</h2></a>
<p>When you make changes locally, you probably want to see how it looks before making a commit.
You can install the tool for this. At the time of writing, [pre-built binaries] exist for Linux and MacOS,
but not for Windows.</p>
<p>For windows, I have compiled <a href="https://github.com/Ecam-Eurobot/Tutorials/releases/tag/files">a binary</a> that you can use.
You can also <strong>compile mdBook from source</strong>, but this falls outside the scope of this tutorial.</p>
<p>When you have mdBook, add it to your path so that you can use it in the terminal / command line from anywhere.
For this, I will refer you to external documentation: <a href="https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/26047/how-to-correctly-add-a-path-to-path">Linux / MacOS</a>
&amp; <a href="http://www.itprotoday.com/management-mobility/how-can-i-add-new-folder-my-system-path">Windows</a>.</p>
<p>Now everything is setup, you should be able to open the terminal / command line and type <code>mdbook --help</code> and see the following:</p>
<pre><code>mdBook --help

USAGE:
    mdbook.exe [SUBCOMMAND]

FLAGS:
    -h, --help       Prints help information
    -V, --version    Prints version information

SUBCOMMANDS:
    build    Build the book from the markdown files
    clean    Delete built book
    help     Prints this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)
    init     Create boilerplate structure and files in the directory
    serve    Serve the book at http://localhost:3000. Rebuild and reload on change.
    test     Test that code samples compile
    watch    Watch the files for changes

For more information about a specific command, try `mdbook &lt;command&gt; --help`
Source code for mdbook available at: https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/mdBook
</code></pre>
<p>The two command that are the most interesting for you are <code>build</code> and <code>serve</code>.</p>
<p>Running <code>mdbook build</code> in the folder where the <code>book.toml</code> is located will generate the book.
The generated book can then be found in the <code>book/</code> folder.</p>
<p>Running <code>mdbook serve</code> is even better, because it will watch the files for any changes and rebuild the book automatically.
On top of that, it serves the book on <code>http://localhost:3000</code> and automatically refreshes the browser after regenerating the book.
You launch it once, when you begin to write and forget about it. It is that simple.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#hosting" id="hosting"><h2>Hosting</h2></a>
<p>When you visit the following address: <a href="https://ecam-eurobot.github.io/Tutorials/">https://ecam-eurobot.github.io/Tutorials/</a> you can find this book online.
To host the website, we use GitHub. In the repository of the book, there is a branch called <code>gh-pages</code>. This is a special branch that can be used to host a
static website through GitHub.</p>
<p>When you push a new version of the generated book to this branch, it will be accessible online from the address above.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong><br />
<strong>Don't push manually</strong> to this branch. As explained below, a new version of the book is generated and pushed automatically on each new
commit on the master branch!</p>
</blockquote>
<a class="header" href="print.html#travis" id="travis"><h2>Travis</h2></a>
<p>We have setup <a href="https://travis-ci.org/">Travis</a> to generate the book for each new commit on the master branch. This means that the hosted book is <strong>always</strong>
up to date, with a couple of minutes delay.</p>
<p>The travis configuration file looks like the following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml">sudo: false

<a class="header" href="print.html#mechanical" id="mechanical"><h1>Mechanical</h1></a>
<p>As every year, <strong>a big part</strong> of conceiving the robot is <strong>designing the mechanical parts</strong>. The requirements change with the years, but as a big innovation in 2018, we suggest to keep the <a href="mechanical/mecanum.md">Mecanum wheels</a> system. According to the rules, you'll have to <strong>realize</strong> diverse <strong>action</strong> in order to <strong>get points</strong>.</p>
<p>For example, in 2018, the actions were:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Collecting blocs</strong>, lift them, sort them according to their color and build a tower with them.</li>
<li><strong>Collecting balls</strong> from a pipe,  sort them by color and evacuate them to a lower position and to a higher one.</li>
</ul>
<p>You'll find more information about the designed mechanisms in the two dedicated chapters (<a href="mechanical/2018/lift.md">Lift</a> &amp; <a href="mechanical/2018/balls.md">Ball mechanism</a>).</p>
<p>Before that, we want to introduce you to one of <strong>our main tools</strong> to design those mechanisms and build them. These are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="mechanical/fusion.md">Fusion 360</a>, to design <strong>3D models</strong>.</li>
<li><a href="mechanical/3d-print.md">3D Printing</a>, to <strong>make</strong> the <strong>pieces</strong> we <strong>designed</strong> or <strong>found on the internet</strong> <strong>fast</strong> and <strong>cheap</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<a class="header" href="print.html#a1-getting-in-touch-with-fusion360" id="a1-getting-in-touch-with-fusion360"><h1>1. Getting in touch with Fusion360</h1></a>
<p>Fusion360 is a 3D modeling software used by many professionals and hobbyists to create pieces. You can directly send your models to slicers in order to print them or export the 2D plans to build it your own. The following few chapters should give you a global overview of how Fusion360 works and what you can use it for. We'll try to orient our writing to learn your to design in order to print your models later and will end with some tips about the printing of your designs.</p>
<p>To complete your learning we strongly recommend you subscribe to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCo29kn3d9ziFUZGZ50VKvWA">Lars Christensen's Youtube channel</a>. He's a master in the use of Fusion360 and has very well made videos about every problem of question you might have.</p>
<p>3 videos in particular should hold your attention to get started:
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5bc9c3S12g"> Fusion 360 Tutorial for Absolute Beginners— Part 1</a> and of course <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXRMzJWo0-Q"> Fusion 360 Tutorial for Absolute Beginners— Part 2</a>  and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zS8dYA_Iluc&t=614s"> Fusion 360 Tutorial for Absolute Beginners— Part 3</a>.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#fusion360-environment" id="fusion360-environment"><h2>Fusion360 environment</h2></a>
<p>The first window you get when opening Fusion360 for the first time should be this.</p>
<p>By clicking on <img src="img/mechanical/square.png" alt="img" /> you access to the repository holding all your folders.
A good practice is to sort them into other repositories according to their relevance.

<p>We'll let you listen to M.Christensen by clicking on the links of the videos we gave earlier to learn the basics of Fusion360. He's an expert on the subject and honestly the only good way to learn the kind of software is by watching someone do and copy. Please don't learn the shortcuts by heart, you'll learn the most used ones by practicing.</p>

<p>You should already be able to do your first model now but in case of you misted some of the multiple things explained by &quot;Lars&quot;, we would like to give you a quick refresh.</p>
<p>To begin with, note that all function are easily available trough the &quot;s&quot; key shortcut. Just type some word related on what you are searching for and we are pretty sure that you'll find it fast. <em>Note that you can save them by clicking on the curved arrow.</em></p>

<a class="header" href="print.html#a22-useful-functions" id="a22-useful-functions"><h2>2.2. Useful functions</h2></a>
<a class="header" href="print.html#offset" id="offset"><h3>Offset</h3></a>
<p>Offset is a very handy tool when it comes to draw parallel lines.
<img src="img/mechanical/Offset1.png" alt="img" /></p>
<p>The tools works only in sketch mode and you have to already have a reference line (or a shape).
Type the &quot;o&quot; key to open the &quot;offset menu&quot;, you then have to select the reference line you want.
You can either drag and drop the cursor with your mouse or type the value you wish the offset to be.
<img src="img/mechanical/Offset_drag.png" alt="img" /><img src="img/mechanical/OFFSET_VALUE.png" alt="img" />
You'll end with the line/shape you selected offset as you wanted.
<img src="img/mechanical/Offset_finish.png" alt="img" /></p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#sweep" id="sweep"><h3>Sweep</h3></a>
<p>Another useful tool to make pipe, slide and so one is the &quot;sweep&quot;. Start by doing a sketch on one face. for us it will be two circle.
<img src="img/mechanical/Sweep_1.png" alt="img" /></p>
<p>Then stop your current sketch. Go to another face. Start a new sketch (&quot;s&quot; and then &quot;sketch&quot;). Use &quot;spine&quot; (&quot;s&quot; and then &quot;spine&quot;) and draw a line following as much point as you need.
<img src="img/mechanical/Sweep_2.png" alt="img" /></p>
<p>You'll be able now to use &quot;Sweep&quot;, select the space between the two circle as &quot;profile&quot;, select the line as &quot;path&quot; and you'll automatically make a beautiful pipe!
<img src="img/mechanical/Sweep_3.png" alt="img" /></p>
<p>We used it for example for the <a href="https://a360.co/2Jzo4oP">slide</a> in the 2018's ball mechanism.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#revolve" id="revolve"><h3>Revolve</h3></a>
<p>Revolve allows you to create object as if you turned them on a lathe. It comes in handy to make wheels, cannons, ...
To used it you have to first create a shape around an axis. When you create that shape, you have to imagine it round. So you only have to draw &quot;a half cut in your future object&quot;.
<img src="img/mechanical/Vase_shape.png" alt="img" />
Type &quot;s&quot; to access the &quot;search menu&quot; and enter &quot;revolve&quot; to see the tool. You'll have to select the shape and the axis you want and press &quot;enter&quot;.
<img src="img/mechanical/vase_glass.png" alt="img" /></p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#appearance" id="appearance"><h3>Appearance</h3></a>
<p>To make design easier for others to imagine or simply to choose colors and material purely esthetically, the &quot;Appearance&quot; tool is a must! You can archive more or less the same result with the &quot;Physical Material&quot; tool, but this is more often used for simulation. You can also combine those tools to get for example a steel pipe covered in leather without having to create the wrapping in a component.
It is also very handy when creating complex assemblies with little pieces because the different appearance help to see those different pieces.</p>
<p>Appearance is really easy to use. Type &quot;a&quot;, choose the look you like and drag-drop it on the body you want. You can directly drop it in the project tree or on the visual objet.<br />
<img src="img/mechanical/Appearance_tool.png" alt="img" /></p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#pattern" id="pattern"><h3>Pattern</h3></a>
<p>Real time savior, &quot;Pattern&quot; allows you to duplicate sketches, bodies and components on a given distance.
Multiple pattern tools exists. To see then go into the &quot;search menu&quot; and type &quot;Pattern&quot;.
<img src="img/mechanical/multiple_patterns.png" alt="img" />
As you can see in the above picture, you can create a circular, rectangular or &quot;free style&quot; pattern.
For both rectangular and circular patterns the ones with white square create pattern in sketches. The grey ones create patterns of volumes (bodies, components). We'll only present the sketch pattern, but the volumes work in a similar way.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#rectangular-pattern" id="rectangular-pattern"><h4>Rectangular pattern</h4></a>
<p><img src="img/mechanical/Pattern_open.png" alt="img" />
To apply rectangular patterns, select the desired shape and the amount of copies you want in the 2 directions. You can then enter (or drag-drop) the distance on which you want to copy that shape for both directions and click &quot;ok&quot;.
<img src="img/mechanical/Rect_patt_1side.png" alt="img" />
<img src="img/mechanical/Rect_patt_2side.png" alt="img" />
<img src="img/mechanical/Rect_pattern_done.png" alt="img" /></p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#circular-pattern" id="circular-pattern"><h4>Circular pattern</h4></a>
<p>Circular patterns work in a similar way accept the fact you have to choose a center point and you can choose to make a complete revolution around it you on a given angle.
<img src="img/mechanical/circ_patt-full.png" alt="img" />
<img src="img/mechanical/circ_patt_angle.png" alt="img" /></p>
<p><em>Note that it's also possible to draw a path and then follow it with our pattern.</em></p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#mirror" id="mirror"><h3>Mirror</h3></a>
<p>Available in sketch and also in 3D, the &quot;Mirror&quot; tool is very useful to create quickly two times the same things symmetrically from a line or a plane.</p>
<p>For the 3D, begin draw your piece, in this case, a notch to close a wall.
<img src="img/mechanical/Mirror_1.png" alt="img" /></p>
<p>Use the Mirror tool. Select the faces that you want to copy and then the plane.
<img src="img/mechanical/Mirror_2.png" alt="img" />
<em>Note that if you select only the top face of your notch you won't be able to copy it because the program doesn't allow you to create a new face in the empty space. You have to select all the three faces of your notch.</em>
<img src="img/mechanical/Mirror_3.png" alt="img" /></p>
<p>As We said, it's also available for Sketch mode. So if we want to make two holes symmetric. Just draw a circle (&quot;c&quot; key). Draw a construction line that we'll use as our center line. (&quot;x&quot; key and then &quot;l&quot; key). Chose the distance from the center line (&quot;d&quot; key).Then select &quot;Mirror&quot;, select the circle as &quot;Object&quot; and in the &quot;Mirror line&quot; select the construction line
<img src="img/mechanical/Mirror_4.png" alt="img" />
<img src="img/mechanical/Mirror_5.png" alt="img" /></p>
<p>We can now make our two holes. Select the two of them (with &quot;ctrl&quot;) and then cut them (&quot;q&quot; key).
<img src="img/mechanical/Mirror_6.png" alt="img" /></p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#fillet" id="fillet"><h3>Fillet</h3></a>
<p>As you used it in Autocad or similars, Fillet allow you to joint two lines to make one curve.
In Fusion 360, as a 3D software, you'll also find the possibility to &quot;curve&quot; your 3D model.
<img src="img/mechanical/Fillet_1.png" alt="img" /></p>
<figure>
  <figcaption>Fig. - First Fillet is for sketck and the second one for 3D model.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>To use the sketch fillet, just select it and then click on the two lines to join.
<img src="img/mechanical/Fillet_2.png" alt="img" /></p>
<p>In the 3D model, just select the ridge and with the arrow or value chose the size of your fillet.
<img src="img/mechanical/Fillet_3.png" alt="img" />
<img src="img/mechanical/Fillet_4.png" alt="img" /></p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#chamfer" id="chamfer"><h3>Chamfer</h3></a>
<p>In the same way of thinking than for the Fillet, you'll have the possibility to make some Chamfer.
<img src="img/mechanical/Chamfer_1.png" alt="img" />
Select the tools and click on the ridge.
<img src="img/mechanical/Chamfer_2.png" alt="img" />
You'll also be able to do it with a curved ridge (the one made with fillet)
<img src="img/mechanical/Chamfer_3.png" alt="img" />
<img src="img/mechanical/Chamfer_4.png" alt="img" />
<em>Note that in this case you'll be limited by the angle of the previous made fillet.</em></p>
<p>Another option is to change the &quot;Chamfer type&quot; and select &quot;Distance and angle&quot; to make a chamfer with a selected angle.
<img src="img/mechanical/Chamfer_5.png" alt="img" /></p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#join" id="join"><h3>Join</h3></a>
<p>A joint is a link between two pieces that describes the way they move one on the other. Is comes in handy when describing actions to external people, or when modeling pieces in an assembly to avoid collisions due to design mistakes.
To create joints, you have to first <strong>ground components</strong>. By grounding components you avoid them to move, and so you can use them as a static reference. Take <em>Cortex</em> for example, the base has been grounded and all the rest around him has been jointed.
<img src="img/mechanical/cortex.png" alt="img" />
This means you can not drag it around. The second thing you have to do is <strong>create rigid groups</strong>. By searching for &quot;rigid group&quot; when hitting the &quot;s&quot; key you will enter the &quot;rigid group&quot; menu. You can now select all the component that should move together. You'll still be able to drag them around, but only as one group and not separately anymore. This is for example the case for the mecanum wheels as you can not move is different pieces separately.
After this is done, we can now <strong>join modules together</strong> ('j' key). To do so select the points of the modules that will touch after jointing starting with the one you want to be able to move.
<img src="img/mechanical/joint_face1.png" alt="img" /><img src="img/mechanical/joint_face2.png" alt="img" /></p>
<p>After this is done you can select the type of joint you want and the axis along which to movement will have to be.</p>
<p><img src="img/mechanical/joint_type.png" alt="img" /><img src="img/mechanical/joint_defined.png" alt="img" />
After confirming the settings, you can right-click on the joint to edit the joints limits and inverse the natural rotation.
<img src="img/mechanical/joint_limit.png" alt="img" /></p>

<p>One of the main reason you have to make a 3D model before starting the actual build of your project is the ease you get to make 2D plan you can send to a manufacture or use to build the pieces your own. Making this plans will save you a lot of time and material because all the testing of designs is made virtually and not with physical materials you have to buy, cut, test, re-cut , etc...

<p>A window pops up to specify the parts you want to include in the drawing and the format of the destination sheet (<strong>be careful on that</strong>) select the piece and click &quot;ok&quot;.
<img src="img/mechanical/drawing_drop.png" alt="img" /></p>
<p>A widget is automatically created and the component is now attached to your mouse. Notice that in the small window that comes with the widget you can select the view and scale you want to use. After dropping the component and clicking &quot;ok&quot; on the small window your drawing is fully generated and you can start editing it.

<p>Now comes the fun part: 3D printing your own designs. You'll see that it is really satisfying to see something you designed your own &quot;come to live&quot; in the printer and to do so you will have to export you design as an '.stl' file.</p>
<p>First start by hitting the &quot;make&quot; icon in the top bar.
<img src="img/mechanical/make_icon.png" alt="img" />
It will open a window asking you to select the component you want to print and where you want to send the stl file. As you might expect you have to click on the body or component you want to print. As most printers have a accuracy only as good as their nozzle diameter, an assembly will always be printed a one bloc! For that reason we recommend to only select bodies when printing an assembly. It takes more time to print, but is the pieces have to move their is no other way to avoid monolithic prints.</p>
<p>Now comes the moment you have to choose between send you design to a facility (and generating an stl file) or print it from your computer and so send it to a slicer software (up studio for the small printer in ECAM's electronic lab, Ultimaker Cura, Repetier-host, etc...).

<p>To <strong>3D print it from your computer</strong> select &quot;Send to 3D print utility&quot; and link you slicer software by clicking on the folder icon. When the slicer is linked click &quot;ok&quot; and launch the print form your slicer that will have been open and loaded with the design by Fusion360.</p>

<p><img src="img/mechanical/mecanum/mecanum.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>A mecanum wheel is a wheel with rollers attached at its circumference at an angle of typically 45°.
When four mecanum wheels are used together, we can achieve a net resulting direction in <strong>any</strong> direction by varying the direction and speed of rotation of the wheels.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#assembly" id="assembly"><h2>Assembly</h2></a>
<a class="header" href="print.html#wheel-adapter" id="wheel-adapter"><h3>Wheel adapter</h3></a>
<p>To mount the wheels onto the motors, we need to use an adapter.
Due to an error in our order, we didn't receive the correct adapters and the ones we received didn't fit on the wheels.</p>
<p>We decided to 3D print our own as a replacement. The <a href="">STL file for this part can be found here</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong><br />
3D printing parts that will be under moderate or heavy mechanical stress is often not the best idea, because those parts will tend to break and/or wear out quickly.</p>
</blockquote>
<a class="header" href="print.html#wheel-orientation" id="wheel-orientation"><h3>Wheel orientation</h3></a>
<p>When assembling the wheels onto the robot, we need to pay attention to their orientation.
If we look from the top view, the rollers should all point to the center of the base.</p>

<a class="header" href="print.html#kinematics" id="kinematics"><h2>Kinematics</h2></a>
<p><strong>Forward kinematics</strong> refers to the use of the kinematic equations of a robot to compute the position of the end-effector from specified values for the joint parameters. In our case, the forward kinematics allow us to compute the global velocity of the robots base when given the angular velocities of the individual wheels.</p>
<p>The reverse process that computes the joint parameters that achieve a specified position of the end-effector is known as <strong>inverse kinematics</strong>. The inverse kinematic equations allow us, in our case, to compute the individual wheel velocities needed to achieve a given base velocity.</p>
<p>The equations presented in the next sections come from the following research paper: <a href="https://research.ijcaonline.org/volume113/number3/pxc3901586.pdf">&quot;Kinematic Model of a Four Mecanum Wheeled Mobile Robot&quot;</a></p>

<p>In 2018, the two big mechanical tasks were:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Collect cubes</strong> that are distributed at specific locations on the playing field. The collected blocks then need to be stacked
to create a tower. For each story (level), a bigger amount of points were given. Additionally, if the tower contained
the 3 cube séquence, revealed at the beginning of the match, additionnal points were earned.</li>
<li><strong>Collect foam ping-pong balls</strong> from the dispensers. The robot first has to open the lock so that the balls can fall out
of the dispenser. Then the robot had to sort the balls and, depending on their color, either shoot them into a &quot;tower&quot;
or put them in another recipient.</li>

<p>The robot has to collect the cubes and to build a tower of 5 cubes maximum in the construction zone (<strong>number 4</strong>).
The team earns a lot a point if it respects the construction plan shown on the wall (<strong>number 7</strong>).</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#sections--how-does-it-work-" id="sections--how-does-it-work-"><h2>Sections ( How does it work ?)</h2></a>
<p>This paragraph explains the differents conceptions's steps and all the parts needed to build a tower. Here is the general flow diagram :</p>
<p><img src="mechanical/2018/bigRobotSrc/flow_diagram.PNG" alt="alt text" /></p>
<p>The system doesn't need any color detection because all the stars of cubes are always in the same order in the same direction.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#the-base" id="the-base"><h3>The base</h3></a>
<p><img src="mechanical/2018/bigRobotSrc/base_render.jpg" alt="alt text" /></p>
<p>This is the firt thing I'm going to talk about but it was the last designed part. Indeed, every part had to be designed to know the constraints and dimensions. Thoses informations where essentials to design the base.</p>
<p>After the design in Fusion 360 in the model environment, the design was imported to the CAM environment still in Fusion.</p>
<p><img src="mechanical/2018/bigRobotSrc/base_cam.PNG" alt="alt text" /></p>
<p>It was then machined with a CNC :</p>
<p><img src="mechanical/2018/bigRobotSrc/base_machining.jpg" alt="alt text" /></p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#the-entry" id="the-entry"><h3>The entry</h3></a>
<p>To swallow the cubes, an entry was designed. It uses simple DC motor with paint roller bought at the <em>Brico</em>.</p>
<p><img src="mechanical/2018/bigRobotSrc/entry.PNG" alt="alt text" /></p>
<p>The entry swallows the first 3 cubes and then select the fourth cube between the 2 last by pushing it with the toothed rack. After that the robot do the same step with the last cube. The rack moves with a rail available on <em>RS component</em> :</p>
<p><strong>IGUS rail</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Rail</em> :Igus N Series, NS-01-17-300, Linear Guide Rail 17mm width 300mm length</li>
<li><em>Carriage</em> : Igus Linear Guide Carriage NW-02-17, N</li>
</ul>
<p>To detect when the cube is in the lift, the robot uses a limit switch available on <em>RS Component</em> :</p>
<p><strong>Limit switch</strong> : Snap Action Limit Switch, Roller Lever, Thermoplastic, NC, 125V.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#the-lift" id="the-lift"><h3>The lift</h3></a>
<p>The limit switch used in the entry is connected to a pin of an Arduino Uno board so we can detect the state change when a block touches the switch.
That event triggers the lift and thus the block starts to raise up.
Therefore we are using another DC motor with a belt as you can see on the picture below.</p>
<p><img src="mechanical/2018/bigRobotSrc/lift_motor_belt.png" alt="img" /></p>
<p>Thanks to the colour detection we know in which order we have to collect the blocks on the field, so we also know which one comes first in the lift and which floor it has to go to.
It is important to know the specific floor in order to create the pattern showed at the beginning of the game and recognised by the colour and sequence recognition part.</p>
<p>To know when the lift has to stop, we use the encoder of the DC motor so we can precisely know when the motor has to stop.
The encoder is connected to an interruption pin on the Arduino board so the tick counts can be more accurate and have priority.</p>
<p>Once the block is on the right floor, it has to be pushed outside of the lift to already be placed in its position on the tower on a kind of shelf (as you can see in the picture below) which supports the blocks even if there is no other block below.</p>
<p><img src="mechanical/2018/bigRobotSrc/cage.jpg" alt="img" /></p>
<p>Furthermore, to push the block, we use a dynamixel with a gear and a tooth rack to slide a plate along which pushes the block until it reaches the « shelf ».</p>
<p><img src="mechanical/2018/bigRobotSrc/tooth_rack.png" alt="img" /></p>
<p>Then the lift (without any block inside) goes down. To make sure it doesn’t go too much we use another limit switch.
Therefore the lift is immediately stopped, another cube comes in and we can do the cube lifting steps mentioned before over again until all the cubes of the tower are placed.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, we are using DC motors to control our lift.
We have in all 3 motors and they are all connected to a L298 driver (see picture below) controlled by an Arduino Uno board.</p>
<p>Here is a link where you can buy the driver :</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.fr/L298-Motor-Driver/s?ie=UTF8&amp;page=1&amp;rh=i%3Aaps%2Ck%3AL298%20Motor%20Driver">https://www.amazon.fr/L298-Motor-Driver/s?ie=UTF8&amp;page=1&amp;rh=i%3Aaps%2Ck%3AL298%20Motor%20Driver</a></p>
<p><img src="mechanical/2018/bigRobotSrc/driver_L298.png" alt="img" /></p>
<p>We use 2 motors for the rollers to collect the blocks. In order to do so, each one has to turn in the opposite direction of the other but at the same speed.
Thus we connected them to the same driver but inverted the pins of one motor compared to the other one.
These motors don’t have an encoder so their only 2 pins are connected to the driver. We also have the third motor to make the lift go up and down. As we said before, we use the encoder to know where we have to stop so there are pins of the motor connected to the Arduino board. On the other hand the motor is also connected to the driver so we can control its speed, stop it and launch it.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#the-cage" id="the-cage"><h3>The cage</h3></a>
<p><img src="mechanical/2018/bigRobotSrc/cage.jpg" alt="alt text" /></p>
<p>The floors can rotate thanks to a dynamixel and a bearing wheel. To place the bearing wheel on the rotating axis we insert the last floor into the others floors with the bearing wheel between them as shown in the next figure :</p>

<a class="header" href="print.html#a3d-sketch" id="a3d-sketch"><h2>3D sketch</h2></a>
<p>All the parts of the ball gun is designed on Fusion 360 and printed on a 3D printer except of the balls and the wheel.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#why-a-ball-gun" id="why-a-ball-gun"><h2>Why a ball gun?</h2></a>
<p>For the 2018 contest, we had to collect and sort balls by color and then put all the balls collected in the color of the team previously known in a big tank that made reference of a water castle as the balls made reference of water itself. The more balls we threw in the tank, the more points we earned.</p>
<p>We choose to throw the balls with a gun made of a ramp for the direction of the ball and a wheel with a DC motor. as shown on the picture, you can see a fixed ramp, an adjustable ramp and the wheel.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#construction-step-by-step" id="construction-step-by-step"><h2>Construction step by step</h2></a>
<p>After lots of discussions with the team, I decided to choose the ball gun to complete the task of throwing balls in the tank. So I first made a prototype of the ball gun made of wood and a small DC motor I found in the lab but for the first tests it appeared that the small DC motor wasn't powerfull enough. So I choose a more powerfull and a better speed motor as a Maxon motor found in the lab and the results were very conclusive.</p>
<p><img src="mechanical/2018/BallGun_SRC/BallGunPrototype.jpg" alt="alt text" /></p>
<p>The next step was to control the speed of the wheel so we could control the distance the ball make after throwing by the ball gun.</p>
<p>I used a small motor driver as the L293D which the specifications were in agreement with the needs of the DC motor.</p>
<p><img src="mechanical/2018/BallGun_SRC/L293DAbsolute.png" alt="alt text" /></p>
<p><img src="mechanical/2018/BallGun_SRC/L293DRecommended.png" alt="alt text" /></p>
<p>You can find the datasheet of the L293D here : https://github.com/Ecam-Eurobot/Tutorials/tree/StevenGaro-patch-1/src/mechanical/2018/BallGun_SRC</p>
<p>To control the H bridge driver, I used a simple arduino uno with a PWM signal so we could test different speeds of the motor.</p>
<p><img src="mechanical/2018/BallGun_SRC/SchemaBlock.png" alt="alt text" /></p>
<p>The precision of the distance the ball make was made experimentaly when we did the different tests.</p>
<p>The code I first used to test the driver with the motor is the next code in arduino :</p>
<pre><code>int inputPin = A0;  // set input pin for the potentiometer
int inputValue = 0; // potentiometer input variable

const int motorPin1  = 5;  // Pin 14 of L293
const int motorPin2  = 6;  // Pin 10 of L293

void setup() {
     // declare the ledPin as an OUTPUT:
     pinMode(motorPin1, OUTPUT);
     
}

void loop() {
     // read the value from the potentiometer:
     inputValue = analogRead(inputPin);

     // send the square wave signal to the LED:
     analogWrite(motorPin1, inputValue);

  digitalWrite(motorPin1, HIGH);
  delayMicroseconds(inputValue); // Approximately 10% duty cycle @ 1KHz
  digitalWrite(motorPin1, LOW);
  delayMicroseconds(1023 - inputValue);
     
}
</code></pre>
<p>When the tests were conclusive enough, we designed a ramp that fit in the robot correctly with an adjustable ramp for the ball to go higher or lower in case we need to modify the distance during the competition.</p>
<p>First we made the fixed ramp that comes from the ball sorting mecanism and end around the wheel.</p>
<p><img src="mechanical/2018/BallGun_SRC/FixedRamp.png" alt="alt text" /></p>
<p>After that we made a straight ramp that shows the ball the direction it must take.</p>
<p><img src="mechanical/2018/BallGun_SRC/StraightRamp.png" alt="alt text" /></p>
<p>And finaly, we designed a small piece that maintain the straight ramp from below and that you can adjust.</p>
<p><img src="mechanical/2018/BallGun_SRC/PieceAdjust.png" alt="alt text" /></p>
<p>After that, all we had to do is to install the gun in the robot and make some tests to determine the best power to give as a PWM to the motor to throw the balls from the distance chosen in the tank and to incorporate the code of the ball gun in the main code of the robot.</p>

</ul>
<a class="header" href="print.html#examples-of-use" id="examples-of-use"><h1>Examples of use</h1></a>
<p>To use the dynamixels, it is necessary to download first the library &quot;AX_12A_servo_library&quot; that you can find on the github of eurobot here : https://github.com/Ecam-Eurobot/Tutorials/tree/master/src/electronics/actuators/Dynamixels_SRC</p>
<p>You'll have to extract it and place it in Documents/Arduino/libraries.</p>
<p>To configure the dynamixels, we'll use the Arduino software app.</p>
<p>This library possess 4 exemples of use of the dynamixel :</p>
<ul>
<li>Blink : example of control of the red led you can find in the back of every dynamixel</li>
<li>Move : example of control of the dynamixel in servomotor mode by giving it a position</li>
<li>EndlessTurn : example of use in DC motor mode (or wheel mode)</li>
<li>ReadRegister : usefull to dispaly the contents of the registers of the dynamixel</li>
</ul>
<p>These examples are located in Fichier&gt;Exemples&gt;AX-12A on the Arduino app on your computer.</p>
<p>After selecting one of the examples, you have to include the library AX-12A without declaring a specific path because the library is located in the fold &quot;libraries&quot; of the fold &quot;Arduino&quot;.</p>
<p><img src="electronics/actuators/Dynamixels_SRC/Exemples_Include.png" alt="alt text" /></p>
<p>After that you have to configure 3 lines in the code that respond to the needs of the configuration of the connected dynamixel you want to configure :</p>
<pre><code>#define DirectionPin  (10u)
#define BaudRate      (1000000ul)
#define ID            (1u)
</code></pre>
<p>&quot;DirectionPin&quot; is used to indicate the communication direction of the dynamixel. 10u is for writing in the registers so you don't have to change the value.</p>
<p>&quot;BaudRate&quot; defines the communication speed used ( and configurate before with the Dynamixel Wizard)</p>
<p>&quot;ID&quot; represents the ID of the dynamixel that you checked or configured before for the addressing.</p>

<a class="header" href="print.html#sonar" id="sonar"><h1>Sonar</h1></a>
<p>A sonar is a sensor allowing you to measure the distance to an obstacle thanks to high frequency waves. To keep correct measured values it is better to use the sensor we chose between 2cm and 400cm. The model of our sonar is HC-SR04. There are 4 pins on this sensor : TRIG, ECHO, VCC and GND (as you can see on the picture below).</p>
<p><img src="img/electronics/sonar/HCSR04.png" alt="img" /></p>
<p>It contains a transmitter and a receiver.
The distance measure is pretty simple. Firstly, you have to send a signal on the TRIG pin so the sonar emits a wave of 8 pulses at 40kHz. Then the ECHO pin is set to the «HIGH» level until the emitted signal goes to the obstacle and comes back to the sensor (as you can see on the following picture).</p>
<p><img src="img/electronics/sonar/ultrasonic_waves.png" alt="img" /></p>
<p>Of course, you have to connect the sensor to a microcontroller. You can connect the VCC to the 5V pin of your board, the GND to the ground pin and the TRIG and ECHO to digital pins of your controller as illustrated on the picture below.</p>
<p><img src="img/electronics/sonar/sonar_pins.png" alt="img" /></p>
<p>Finally it is also important to know that the measuring angle with the HC-SR04 sonar is 30 degrees.</p>
<p>All these information are also explained in the following websites :</p>

<a class="header" href="print.html#simple-arduino-code" id="simple-arduino-code"><h2>Simple Arduino code</h2></a>
<p>To be able to test the simple code showed in this part you have to connect the sonar sensor to your Arduino Uno board as showed on the third picture hereinabove. You also have to connect the TRIGG pin of the sonar to the pin 12 on your Arduino board and the ECHO pin of the sonar to the pin 13 on the Arduino board. Of course you can change these values on the following code if needed.<br />
You are now ready to upload the code :</p>
<pre><code class="language-cpp">
#define TRIGG 12 // Broche TRIGGER
#define ECHO 13    // Broche ECHO
                                               // definition du Timeout
const long TIMEOUT = 25000UL; // 25ms = ~8m à 340m/s

float son= 340.0 / 1000; //vitesse du son dans l'air (mm/µs)

void setup() {

  pinMode(TRIGG, OUTPUT);  //Configuration des broches
  digitalWrite(TRIGG, LOW); // La broche TRIGGER doit être à LOW au repos
  pinMode(ECHO, INPUT);

  Serial.begin(9600); //Démarrage de la liaison série
}
 
void loop() {
  
  digitalWrite(TRIGG, HIGH); // Lance une mesure de distance en envoyant 
  delayMicroseconds(10);  //une impulsion HIGH de 10µs sur la broche TRIGGER
  digitalWrite(TRIGG, LOW);
  
  int mesure = pulseIn(ECHO, HIGH, TIMEOUT); // Mesure le temps entre 
                                          // l'envoi de l'ultrason et sa réception

  float distance_mm = mesure / 2.0 * son; //calcul de la distance grâce au temps
                                      //on divise par 2 car le son fait un aller-retour
   
  Serial.print(&quot;Distance: &quot;); //Affichage des résultats
  Serial.print(distance_mm);
  Serial.println(&quot;mm&quot;);

  delay(500); //temps entre chaque mesure (ms)
}

<p>To verifiy if everything is working correctly after uploading the code you can click on the Serial monitor icon on the Arduino IDE (as shown on the picture below) to see what distance the sonar returns in milimeters.</p>

<a class="header" href="print.html#arduino-ros-code" id="arduino-ros-code"><h2>Arduino ROS code</h2></a>
<p>This tutorial explains the code to use and transfer sonar sensors information with ROS.</p>
<p>For the «Cortex» robot we used four sensors, one on each side so that’s what the final code presented at the end of this tutorial is based on.</p>
<p>Firstly, in this code we are going to include the same libraries as shown in the Arduino Publisher Tutorial so you can refer to that part for the explanations.
An additional useful library used for the sensors is the NewPing.h. So here are all the necessary libraries :</p>
<pre><code class="language-cpp">#include &lt;ros.h&gt;
#include &lt;sensor_msgs/Range.h&gt;
#include &lt;NewPing.h&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Then you have to define the pins for each sensor. In this case, the ultrasound sensor has two pins (Trigger ans Echo). Here is an exemple with the sensor located on the right of the robot:</p>
<pre><code class="language-cpp">#define TRIGGER_PINR  5
#define ECHO_PINR    4   
</code></pre>
<p>You also have to specify the maximum distance at which you want the sensor to still be able to detect :</p>
<pre><code class="language-cpp">#define MAX_DISTANCE 300
</code></pre>
<p>Now as we are using the NewPing library you can simply create an ultrasound sensor object by doing this :</p>
<pre><code class="language-cpp">NewPing sonarR(TRIGGER_PINR, ECHO_PINR, MAX_DISTANCE);
</code></pre>
<p>where you specify the pins and the maximum distance defined previously.</p>
<p>Moreover as mentioned in the Arduino Publisher Tutorial you specify the type of the ultrasound message and the name you want to assign to it :</p>
<pre><code class="language-cpp">sensor_msgs::Range range_msg_right;
</code></pre>
<p>You also have to add the following line which has also been explained in the Arduino Publisher Tutorial :</p>
<pre><code class="language-cpp">ros::Publisher pub_range4(&quot;ultrasound_right&quot;, &amp;range_msg_right);
</code></pre>
<p>We then have to fill each sonar object with the initialisation information associated :</p>
<pre><code class="language-cpp">range_msg_right.radiation_type = sensor_msgs::Range::ULTRASOUND;
range_msg_right.header.frame_id =  &quot;ultrasound_right&quot;;
range_msg_right.field_of_view = 0.3665;  // fake
range_msg_right.min_range = 0.0;
range_msg_right.max_range = MAX_DISTANCE;
</code></pre>
<p>Now we can add parts to the void loop of the Arduino code. The most important and useful one specifies the distance to an obstacle :</p>
<pre><code class="language-cpp">range_msg_right.range = tmp/100;
</code></pre>
<p>We can then publish that information about the distance (you can again refer to the Arduino Publisher Tutorial for the publishing part) :</p>
<pre><code class="language-cpp">pub_range4.publish(&amp;range_msg_right);
</code></pre>
<p>Here is the whole code for four ultrasound sensors based on the one presented in this link :
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm3e-51ohgQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm3e-51ohgQ</a><br />
Moreover the code below is available in the Github repo of Ecam Eurobot : <a href="https://github.com/Ecam-Eurobot/Eurobot-2018/blob/ultrasound/arduino/sonar.ino">https://github.com/Ecam-Eurobot/Eurobot-2018/blob/ultrasound/arduino/sonar.ino</a></p>
<p>You can find the tutorial in the Software chapter, ROS and Arduino part to test if you succesfully receive information from the sonar with rosserial.</p>

<a class="header" href="print.html#printed-circuit-boards" id="printed-circuit-boards"><h1>Printed Circuit Boards</h1></a>
<p>Three types of printed circuit boards were developed for our two robots. The following section presents these boards, it utilities and it conception
and gives you all the necessary elements to understand, recreate and use it.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#starting-board" id="starting-board"><h2>Starting Board</h2></a>
<p>Inspired by past version of the starting board</p>
<p>The utility of this PCB is to gather the component serving to the start sequence. Normally this is the only interface with the robot during the
competition.</p>
<p>First, we used three switches for configuring three mains points of our robot :</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Team configuration
We have to setup the starting side for the next match to the robot. It behaviour is different if the robot play as the green or the orange team.
Consequently, this switch set this point before the match start.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Strategy Configuration
It makes possible to choose between two kinds of implemented strategies before the match. For example, just before the start, we have the
possibility of aggressive or defensive strategy, function of the opponent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Initialisation Switch</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This switch launches an initialisation sequence. After the power up of the robot and before its first move, we wanted to have the possibility to check
all different robot's systems. This switch indicates with a DEL if all systems are operational. This is a kind of automatic check list before the match
and the first move of the robot.</p>
<p>All these switches are linked to two DEL. First one to electrically confirm switches' position and the associated setting and the second one used to
have the response of the robot operating system. With these two DELs, we are sure that our robot understood all these parameters.</p>

<a class="header" href="print.html#motor-board" id="motor-board"><h2>Motor Board</h2></a>
<p>The goal of this board is to bring individual intelligence for every motor used on our robots. It allows to associate a microcontroller (ATmega328)
with each motor. This main component is used for two aspects : regulation and communication.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#regulation" id="regulation"><h3>Regulation</h3></a>
<p>For the smaller robot, the operating system send speed consign to the four motors. Consequently, the goal for the motor is reaching this speed in a
minimum of time and after conserving this value. The regulator implemented in the microcontrollers is Proportional Integral Derivative regulators.
It's parameters allow to influence the way to consign reaching for the motor. Thanks to it, each motor, individually can follow the ROS order with a
maximum of precision.</p>
<p>PID's parameters were found with experimentation and all sources used for implementation are in the code file.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#communication" id="communication"><h3>Communication</h3></a>
<p>As said in the previous part, this is the operating system ROS the main brain of the robot. Consequently, this brain has to communicate with its slave.
The communication protocol used on our robots is SPI. It induces that a bus has to be built between all motor and ROS. Effectively, a broker gathers
the signal for the motor but in any case each motor has to be linked to the bus. A role of the board is this connection via a SPI connector.</p>
<p>The commented code can be found in the root folder. For more information about the SPI communication, go to the SPI section.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#arduino-communication-shield---spi-broker" id="arduino-communication-shield---spi-broker"><h2>Arduino Communication Shield - SPI Broker</h2></a>
<p>Motor command communication consists of a two-level interface. ROS communicate via ROS Serial (explained in the appropriate section) implemented on an
arduino UNO and this arduino handle the communication with the four individual motors. To help for connections, we designed an arduino shield gathering
simply all SPI bus connections.</p>
<p>Again, you will find more explanation about the SPI communication in the right section and the basis of the ROS Serial use in the related section as

<p>If we had to design another robot with technologies described, there are some decision that we would change.</p>
<ul>
<li>PCB Design</li>
</ul>
<p>The ECAM installation for PCB printing is very useful for prototyping. It is not comparable with PCB that specialised company can create. So, our advice
is the following, as soon as a board is functional and definitive, send it to have a proper and reliable board. Moreover, try to reach this step as soon
as possible.</p>
<ul>
<li>Connection</li>
</ul>
<p>We have underestimated the connection on the different board. Regarding the JST connector, they are solid but hard to disconnect and cable creation is long withtout the right tool. About the 10 pins shrouded header, they are not reliable enough. Opposite to the JST, disconnection is too easy. We really advise against
its use. They were the source of a lot of problems.</p>

<a class="header" href="print.html#a1-introduction" id="a1-introduction"><h2>1 INTRODUCTION</h2></a>
<p>The protocol that we will use is called Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI). It is a synchronous full-duplex serial interface and is commonly used to communicate with on-board peripherals such as EEPROM, FLASH memory, A/D converters, temperature sensors, or in our case a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA).
We assume a working knowledge of the VHDL hardware description language.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#a2-hardware" id="a2-hardware"><h2>2 HARDWARE</h2></a>
<p>SPI is a protocol, in which one device (the master) controls one or more other devices (the slaves). For the master we use an open-source microcontroller prototyping platform, such as the Arduino 101 or a modified Arduino UNO R3. In this document we use Arduino to refer to either platform.
The slave can be a low-cost FPGA prototyping platforms, such as the Xilinx Spartan-6 Avnet LX9 or the Altera Cyclone-IV Terasic DE10-Lite . The repository  includes project files and pin assignments for both these boards. The code is written in VHDL and should work equally well on more powerful boards.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#a21voltage-levels" id="a21voltage-levels"><h3>2.1.Voltage levels</h3></a>
<p>It is very important that the I/O voltage levels of the devices match. Both FPGA boards support 3.3V levels, and are a good match for the Arduino 101. However, the Arduino UNO uses the traditional 5 Volt TTL levels. Instead of using a level shifter, such as the 74LVC245, we opt for converting the Arduino to 3.3V according to Adafruit’s instructions. Running a 16 MHz clock at 3.3V is out of spec. Is said to work, but should really program the fuses to get the frequency down to abt. 13 MHz .</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#a22signals" id="a22signals"><h3>2.2.Signals</h3></a>
<p>The SPI interface is a 4 wire interface. The bus consists of 3 signals plus <em>a slave select</em> signal for each device.</p>
<p><em>SCLK</em>: clock signal sent from the master to all slaves.</p>
<p><em>MOSI</em>: serial data from the master to the slaves (Master Out-Slave In).</p>
<p><em>MISO</em>: serial data from a slave to the master (Master In-Slave Out).</p>
<p><em>SS</em>:  slave select signal for each slave.</p>
<p>Once the Arduino runs at 3.3V, connecting the two devices becomes trivial.</p>

<a class="header" href="print.html#a3-byte--protocol" id="a3-byte--protocol"><h2>3. BYTE – PROTOCOL</h2></a>
<p>With the two devices physically connected, we need a protocol to transfer data. We chose the Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI), a lightweight protocol to connect one master to one or more slaves.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#a31-masterslave" id="a31-masterslave"><h3>3.1 Master/slave</h3></a>
<p>The SPI bus is controlled by a master device (typically a microcontroller) that orchestrates the bus access. The master generates the control signals and regulates the data flow. The illustration below shows a master with three slaves. The master uses the Slave Select (SS) signal to select the slave.</p>
<p><img src="img/electronics/fpga/image3.png" alt="z" /></p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#a32-parameters" id="a32-parameters"><h3>3.2 Parameters</h3></a>
<p>SPI is also a protocol with many degrees of freedom. It is important that the master and slave agree on the voltage levels and maximum clock frequency. The SPI clock polarity (CPOL) and clock phase (CPHA) introduce four more degrees of freedom as shown in the table below.
SPI parameters</p>
<p><img src="img/electronics/fpga/image4.png" alt="z" /></p>
<p>For this article we assume <em>mode 3</em>, where the clock is high when idle; data is driving following the falling edge of the clock and latched on the rising edge.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#a33-operation" id="a33-operation"><h3>3.3. Operation</h3></a>
<p>The protocol is easiest explained with shift registers as shown in the illustration below. The master generates the SPI Clock (<em>SCLK</em>) to initiate the information exchange. Data is shifted on one edge of this clock and is sampled on the opposite edge when the data is stable.</p>
<p><img src="img/electronics/fpga/image5.png" alt="z" /></p>
<p>In mode 3, at the falling edge of <em>SCLK</em>, both devices drive their most significant bit (<em>b7</em>) on their outgoing data line. On the rising edge, both devices clock in this bit into the least significant bit position (<em>b0</em>). After eight <em>SCLK</em> cycles, the master and slave have exchanged their values and each device processes the data received (e.g. writing it to memory). In case there is more data to be exchanged, the registers are loaded with new data and the process repeats itself. Once all data is transmitted, the master stops the <em>SCLK</em> clock.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#a34-slave-select" id="a34-slave-select"><h3>3.4. Slave select</h3></a>
<p>For a more complete picture, we need to include the effect of the <em>slave select</em> (<em>SS</em>*) signal that is used to address the slave devices.</p>
<p><img src="img/electronics/fpga/image6.png" alt="z" /></p>
<p>Slaves may only drive their output (<em>MISO</em>) line when <em>SS</em>* is active, otherwise they should tri-stated the output. The protocol can be broken down into the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The master initiates the communication by activating SS*</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>The slave responds by starting to drive its MISO output.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Meanwhile the master drives its MOSI output.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<p>The master makes SCLK low.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>
<p>On this falling edge, the master and slave drive their most significant bit position (b7) on respectively their MOSI and MISO outputs.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<p>The master makes SCLK high.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>
<p>On this rising edge, the master and slave clock the input from their respectively MISO and MOSI inputs into the least significant bit position (b0).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ol start="4">
<li>
<p>Go back to step 2. Until the least significant bit position (b0) has been sent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When all bits are transmitted, the master deactivates SS*.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<a class="header" href="print.html#a4-bytes-exchange-with-arduino-as-master" id="a4-bytes-exchange-with-arduino-as-master"><h2>4. BYTES EXCHANGE WITH ARDUINO AS MASTER</h2></a>
<p>The Arduino is blessed with a support library for the serial peripheral interface. This greatly aids the implementation. For the slave we used an Altera or Xilinx based FPGA implementation . Refer to the first part of this article for details about the physical connection.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#a5-byte-exchange-with-a-fpga-as-slave" id="a5-byte-exchange-with-a-fpga-as-slave"><h2>5. BYTE EXCHANGE WITH A FPGA AS SLAVE</h2></a>
<p>Implementing the SPI Slave on an FPGA is like old school digital electronics. My key takeaway is to think hardware, not programming. Implementing the <a href="https://coertvonk.com/hw/logic/connecting-fpga-and-arduino-using-spi-13067/3">SPI protocol</a> on a FPGA is fairly straightforward for as long as we use a directly clocked sequential circuit while preventing clock domain crossings.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#a51-sequential-circuit" id="a51-sequential-circuit"><h3>5.1. Sequential circuit</h3></a>
<p>In real life, two signals going to a single gate will not arrive there at the same time due to wire delays. This causes the output to momentarily have an incorrect value. The problem compounds as the signal travels through more gates and wires.</p>
<p>In Building Math Hardware we created elementary math operations using combinatorial circuits. That was OK, because we didn’t care about such output <em>glitches</em> caused by the input signals propagating to the outputs. From a demonstrator’s point of view it even made it more interesting. Talking to a real device, such as a SPI master is different, because it requires the outputs to be stable at certain times.</p>
<p><img src="img/electronics/fpga/image7.png" alt="z" /></p>
<p>The solution is to introduce a clock signal, and store the signals in a flip-flop (registers) at the rising edge of that clock signal. We then only need to ensure that the longest delay from one flip-flop to the next is less that the clock period. This greatly simplifies the design process, at the cost of introducing some delay.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#a52-clock-domain" id="a52-clock-domain"><h3>5.2. Clock domain</h3></a>
<p>Field programmable gate arrays thrive on synchronous designs, but they don’t do well with clock signals that are asynchronous with its system clock.</p>
<p>We also need to avoid transferring data from a <a href="https://coertvonk.com/family/school/inquiries/computer-math-inquiry-4245">flip-flop</a> driven by one clock to a flip-flop driven by another clock. This is called a <em>clock domain crossing</em> and might manifest itself in <em>metastability</em>, data loss or incoherence .We prevent clock domain crossings, by synchronizing the input signals to the FPGA clock using a traditional two-stage shift register as illustrated above.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The first flip-flop creates a synchronous version of the inputs by clocking it with the system clock. The input signal could change within the flip-flop’s <em>setup and hold times</em> and may take longer than a system clock cycle to settle to a stable value (metastability). That’s why it is ran through a second flip-flop.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The second flip-flop, makes it is very unlikely that this metastability propagates to the output.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Adding a third flip-flop gives us access to the previous value. Using the current and previous values, we can generate rise and fall signals as sown below.</p>
<p><img src="img/electronics/fpga/image8.png" alt="z" /></p>
</li>
</ul>
<a class="header" href="print.html#a53-operation" id="a53-operation"><h3>5.3. Operation</h3></a>
<p>The main data object is an 8-bit register called DATA.</p>
<p>On a falling SCLK edge, the most significant bit from data is clocked into a register from where it is transmitted over its MISO output.</p>
<p>On a rising SCLK edge, the MOSI input is shifted into the least significant bit of data.</p>
<p>Once all eight bits are received, the byte is available as rx. This received byte rx should be read when rx Valid is active during a rising edge of the sysClk.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#a6-message-exchange-protocol" id="a6-message-exchange-protocol"><h2>6. MESSAGE EXCHANGE PROTOCOL</h2></a>
<p>The time has come to implement a status and register interface on top of the raw byte exchange. We define a few commands to retrieve the device status and access its 32-bit registers.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#a61-commands" id="a61-commands"><h3>6.1. Commands</h3></a>
<p>The first byte is defined as the command byte. The interpretation of the remaining bytes (if any) depends on this command. After the command is completed, a new command can be sent. The following commands will be supported:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Read status (0x00)</strong>: Reads the status byte.</li>
</ul>
<p>First the master sends 0x00, and ignores the value returned;</p>
<p>the master then sends one dummy byte, to get the 8-bit status value in return.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Read register (0x80 to 0x8F)</strong>: Reads the value stored in one of the sixteen registers.</li>
</ul>
<p>The least significant four bits of the command indicate the register to read from.
First the master sends this command, and ignores the value returned,then the master sends 4 dummy bytes to get the 32-bit register value. The first byte received is the most significant, the fourth is the least significant (network byte order).</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Write register (0xC0 to 0xCF)</strong>: Writes a value to one of the sixteen registers. The least significant four bits indicate the register to write to.</p>
<ul>
<li>First the master sends the command, and ignores the value returned;</li>
<li>Then the master sends 4 bytes with the value to write. The most significant byte is sent first, the least significant last.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<a class="header" href="print.html#a62-registers" id="a62-registers"><h3>6.2. Registers</h3></a>
<p>The FPGA will implement two register types. The first 4 registers (0-3) are <em>read/write</em> and can be used to send information to the FPGA. The next 12 registers (4-15) are <em>read-only</em> to receive information from the FPGA. In the greater scheme, the <em>read/write</em> registers will be used to send math operands to the FPGA, and the read-only registers will be used to read the results from the FPGA.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#a63-room-for-improvement" id="a63-room-for-improvement"><h3>6.3. Room for improvement</h3></a>
<p>The protocol leaves some room for improvement. It can be made more efficient by implementing continuous commands. Here the master issues a <em>read</em> or <em>write register start</em> command, but keeps sending sets of 4-bytes until it has enough. Along similar lines one could implement commands to access attached memory.</p>

<p>The Serial Peripheral Interface bus (SPI) is a synchronous serial communication interface specification used for short distance communication, primarily in embedded systems.</p>
<p>You can see on the picture below the topology of this communictaion interface and the pinout of the components:</p>
<p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fc/SPI_three_slaves.svg/363px-SPI_three_slaves.svg.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>SPI only defines the physical and data link layer of OSI network model. The connection and media between the devices indicates the physical layer. Data link layer defines the way in which the devices are connected. The connections include the input and output lines such as clock, data in and data out. Data link layer in SPI is implied in the connection itself and no provision is made for location or address information.</p>
<p>The communiction frame is writen for the use (Layer three on OSI Model). To begin a communication with a <em>Slave</em>, the <em>Master</em> must fix the Slave Select pin (SS) to <strong>LOW</strong> state. After that, the master can put some bits into the shift register throught the MOSI  (Master Output Slave Input) pin.
When the communication is done, it's the master who must put back the SS to <strong>HIGH</strong> State.</p>

In our case of use, it is the <em>command</em> property of the <a href="https://github.com/Ecam-Eurobot/Eurobot-2018/blob/master/arduino/SPIslave.cpp">SPISlave</a> object which is used as parameter of the <strong>SWITCH</strong>.</p>
<p>the writing in a register will be done once the communication is finished (thanks to the property <em>endTrans</em>). This method of work has the advantage of not having inconsistent values during the communication.</p>
<p>The reading of a registers uses the full-duplex channel provided by the SPI. The data are pushed through the channel during the communication using the <strong>SPDR</strong> register.</p>
<p>Here is an example of a function that contains the registers of a slave:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">void spiReg(){  
switch (mySPI.command) {
  case 0x10:
      if(mySPI.endTrans) {
          for (int i = 0; i &lt; 4; i++){
              motor_speed.b[i] = mySPI.msg[i];
           }
       }
      break;
   case 0x11:
      SPDR = motor_speed.b[mySPI.dataCount - 2];
      break;
   case 0x50:
      motor_encoder.write(0);
      break;    
   case 0x51:
      SPDR = EncoderState.b[mySPI.dataCount - 2];
      break;    
  } 
}

<a class="header" href="print.html#issues-and-context-of-the-eurobot--2018-" id="issues-and-context-of-the-eurobot--2018-"><h2>Issues and context of the Eurobot ( 2018 )</h2></a>
<p>Many technologies have been implemented on the robots for the 2018 edition of the EUROBOT.</p>
<p>Those technologies were a huge step forward in terms of quality, speed and ease of use.</p>
<p>However, unexpected downsides appeared during the implementation of the technologies on the robots.</p>
<p>Thoses downsides are of all type but those who are speaking about during this tutorial are *<em>electronic</em> and <strong>space</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="electronics/communication/CAN_SRC/complex-wiring.png" alt="alt text" title="Logo Title Text 1" /></p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#electronic-problem" id="electronic-problem"><h3>Electronic problem</h3></a>
<p>Once the boards are installend on the robots, they needed a lot of connections between them. The last picture shows the kind of result we got after connecting all the wires.</p>
<p>From that moment it is very complex to add or remove wires because of the big amount of cables.</p>
<p>It is also very complex for the debugging because it is hard to take measures and to find where the error is.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#space-problem" id="space-problem"><h3>Space problem</h3></a>
<p>Another problem wich appeared and that we didn't is the huge space taken by the wires.</p>
<p>During the conception the <strong>mistake</strong> we did is to disregard the size of the wires. In the future, some leeway should be taken on the size of the robot during the conception.</p>
<p>The huge number of wires had also an mechanical impact. It added constraint on the connexions wich often broke.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#le-canbus" id="le-canbus"><h2>Le CANBus</h2></a>
<a class="header" href="print.html#context" id="context"><h3>Context</h3></a>
<p>Those problems have already been met many years ago in the automotive. Indeed, more and more electronic devises were used in the cars for differents purposes :</p>
<ul>
<li>Engine temperature, air...</li>
<li>RPM, speed...</li>
<li>accelerometer...</li>
<li>Safety, ABS, Airbag, opened doors, seatbelt...</li>
</ul>
<a class="header" href="print.html#specifications-1" id="specifications-1"><h3>Specifications</h3></a>
<p>We can cleary see that with the number of wires increasing the wiring harness became a real problem.</p>
<p>To resolve this, BOSCH developped the CANBus with several caracteristics :</p>
<ul>
<li>High speed communication up to 1 Megabit/s (see the table below for more information)</li>
<li>Real time ( wich makes CANBus better than TCP/IP)</li>
<li>Error detection, fast recovery and repair ( stil in real time)</li>
<li>Security and stability</li>
<li>Priorization of transmission</li>
<li>Based on a differiental signal, the CANBus is made for harsh environnements (External noises and fault tolerance)</li>
<li>It uses a twisted pair cable wich limits the noise emition</li>
</ul>
<p>You can see below the speed transmission according to the distances</p>
<p><img src="electronics/communication/CAN_SRC/can_speed.PNG" alt="alt text" /></p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#topology" id="topology"><h4>Topology</h4></a>
<p>Finally, the biggest benefit of the CANBus is his one bus line topology which limits the number of cables to 4. (CAN HIGH, CAN LOW, VCC and GROUND).</p>
<p>This the reason why it is used on every modern car.</p>
<p><img src="electronics/communication/CAN_SRC/can_topology.png" alt="alt text" /></p>
<p>We can see on the last figure a system without the CANBus (left) and a system with the CANBus (right).</p>
<p>Every component, called a node, is connected to the bus line like the figure below :</p>
<p><img src="electronics/communication/CAN_SRC/can_busnode.jpg" alt="alt text" /></p>
<p>By analogy, the CANBus can be represented by a number of people ( the nodes ) in a room ( the bus line ) where everybody screams his informations. Everyelse has the choice to listen or not. A priority system chooses who is going to speak when several people want to speak at the same time.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#the-frame" id="the-frame"><h3>The frame</h3></a>
<p><img src="electronics/communication/CAN_SRC/can_frame.jpg" alt="alt text" /></p>
<p>A data frame is made of different parts :</p>
<ul>
<li>1 dominant bit begins the frame</li>
<li>The ID of the message is made of 11 bits in the standart CAN or 29 bits in the extended CAN.</li>
<li>6 bits which determine the lenght of the frame</li>
<li>The data made of 0...8 bytes</li>
<li>15 bits of CRC to detect errors</li>
<li>ACK</li>
<li>End of frame bit</li>
</ul>
<a class="header" href="print.html#priority-of-transmission" id="priority-of-transmission"><h3>Priority of transmission</h3></a>
<p>When differents nodes whant to talk at the same time on the bus line, it is the ID who is going to determine the priority.</p>
<p>It gives an important advantage to CANBus, it is possible to make priority of transmission by choosing the right ID. For example, in car the brake system is more important than the light system. The ID of the brake system will be lower ( more 0 ) than the light system.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#implementation" id="implementation"><h2>Implementation</h2></a>
<a class="header" href="print.html#hardware" id="hardware"><h3>Hardware</h3></a>
<p><img src="electronics/communication/CAN_SRC/can_hardware.png" alt="alt text" /></p>
<p>The last figure shows the implementation of the CANBus. The implementation is quite easy because of the modules proposed by Microchip.</p>
<p>A node is made of a transceiver, a CAN controller and a microcontroller.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#transceiver" id="transceiver"><h4>Transceiver</h4></a>
<p>Microchip proposes a lot of solutions for the automotive including a transceiver.</p>
<p>It is the MCP2562. Formerly the MCP2551, is used to convert the TTL signal to a differential signal required by the CANBus.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#controller" id="controller"><h4>Controller</h4></a>
<p>Microchip also proposes the CAN controller MCP2515 which implements all the CAN 2.0 specifications. It is able to send and receive data and communicate it via SPI to a microcontroller.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#microcontroller" id="microcontroller"><h4>Microcontroller.</h4></a>
<p>Any microcontroller with an integrated SPI communication can be selected.</p>
<p>For example we can take the famous ATMEGA328p known for his arduino IDE.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#resistance" id="resistance"><h4>Resistance</h4></a>
<p>In every communication wire there is some reflexion that can corrupt the data. It can be avoided by using 120 Ohm resistor at the end of line.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#pcb" id="pcb"><h4>PCB</h4></a>
<p>Coming soon.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#software-arduino" id="software-arduino"><h3>Software (Arduino)</h3></a>
<p>There are many libraries that propose functions to interract with the CAN controller via SPI from the micrcontroller.</p>
<p>A very comlete and up to date library is the Seed studio lib :
<a href="https://github.com/Seeed-Studio/CAN_BUS_Shield">https://github.com/Seeed-Studio/CAN_BUS_Shield</a></p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#filters" id="filters"><h4>Filters</h4></a>
<p>Filters allow to choose wich messages will be sent to the microcontroller from the CAN controller.</p>
<p>The MCP2515 is able the define 6 filters. For example :</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">CAN.init_Filt(0, 0, 0x04);                          
CAN.init_Filt(1, 0, 0x05);                          
</code></pre>
<p>This code means that the CAN controller will only listen to the messages with an ID of 0x04 and 0x05.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#masks" id="masks"><h4>Masks</h4></a>
<p>The masks defines the bits that will be inspected to filter the coming ID. If the bit of the mask is 1, it means that the ID has to respect the bit of the filter.</p>
<p>For example with the following filter :</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">0100 1101
</code></pre>
<p>If the mask is :</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">1111 1111
</code></pre>
<p>Then it means that the accepted ID has to have exactly the same bits thant the filter because all the masks bits are 1. Only a message witch the next ID will be accepted :</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">0100 1101
</code></pre>
<p>Now, if the mask is this one :</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">1111 1110
</code></pre>
<p>It means that the filter will not inspect the last bit of the ID.</p>
<p>The next ID's will be accpeted</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">0100 1100
0100 1101
</code></pre>

<a class="header" href="print.html#software" id="software"><h1>Software</h1></a>
<p>The software is an important part of the Robot. It is often the one that is the most challenging
as to few people work on it. In this part, we are going to introduce you to the software stack of
our robots. We will present the different technologies we used and try to explain many of the concepts
related to them.</p>
<p>In 2018, we build the robots around <strong><a href="http://www.ros.org/">ROS</a></strong>, which is a robotics framework facilitating
software development for robotics. ROS is not easy to start with, but once you get the hang of it, it
greatly improves your productivity. In the <a href="software/ros/ros.html">ROS</a> chapters, we will try to distill the most important
information in order to get you started quickly.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#ros" id="ros"><h1>ROS</h1></a>
<p>ROS or Robot Operating Systems is an open source framework designed for designing robots.
ROS is commonly installed upon a Linux operating system.
There are different ROS versions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lunar (Latest)</li>
<li>Kinetic (LTS)</li>
<li>Jade</li>
<li>Indigo</li>
<li>...</li>
</ul>
<p>The ROS distribution we're using for Eurobot is the 'Kinetic' versions.</p>
<p>What's great about ROS, it's that there is an ever growing community that is sharing their code &amp; projects of robotic machines. This is great because there are many build-in/downloadable libraries ready to use and the end user doesn't need to reinvent the wheel for classic robotic manipulations, like for example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Drivers to read/write to sensors</li>
<li>Robotic algorithms (navigation, interpret sensor data, object manipulation)</li>
<li>...</li>
</ul>
<p>In this section we will go over the basic concepts of ROS, the actual installation and the realisation of a project from scratch.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#installing-ros" id="installing-ros"><h1>Installing ROS</h1></a>
<p>ROS is only officially supported on Ubuntu or Debian, with other platforms being experimental or unofficial. We recommend installing <a href="https://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop">Ubuntu</a> for desktops or laptops and <a href="https://ubuntu-mate.org/raspberry-pi/">Ubuntu Mate</a> for the Raspberry Pi.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#installing-ros-on-a-raspberry-pi" id="installing-ros-on-a-raspberry-pi"><h2>Installing ROS on a Raspberry Pi</h2></a>
<a class="header" href="print.html#installing-ubuntu-mate" id="installing-ubuntu-mate"><h3>Installing Ubuntu Mate</h3></a>
<p><a href="https://ubuntu-mate.org/download/">Download Ubuntu Mate</a> Xenial 16.04, choosing the Raspberry Pi architecture.</p>
<p>The image is compressed. On Windows you can use a tool like 7-zip to decompress it. On Linux and MacOS you can use the following command:</p>
<pre><code>xz -d filename.xz
</code></pre>
<a class="header" href="print.html#writing-the-sd-card" id="writing-the-sd-card"><h4>Writing the SD card</h4></a>
<p>Now we need to write the image file onto the microSD card.</p>
<p>On <strong>Windows</strong> we can use <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/win32diskimager/">Win32 Disk Imager</a>.</p>
<p><img src="img/software/ros/win32diskimager01.png" alt="Win32DiskImager" /></p>
<p>On <strong>Linux</strong> we use the <code>dd</code> command.</p>
<p>First we need to find our SD card using the <code>lsblk</code> command. When you have found the name, you can unmount it.</p>
<pre><code># Find the SD card
lsblk

# Unmount the SD card
sudo umount /dev/sd&lt;?&gt;&lt;?&gt; 

# Copy the image to the SD card
sudo dd if=ubuntu-mate-16.04.2-desktop-armhf-raspberry-pi.img of=/dev/sd&lt;?&gt; bs=4M
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>dd</code> command will take a long time to complete and does not give any feedback. Be patient...</p>
<p>On <strong>MacOS</strong> we also use the <code>dd</code> command, but it is slightly different than for Linux.</p>
<pre><code># Find the SD card
diskutil list

# Unmount the SD card
sudo umount /dev/disk&lt;?&gt;s&lt;?&gt;

# Copy the image to the SD card
sudo dd if=ubuntu-mate-16.04.2-desktop-armhf-raspberry-pi.img of=/dev/disk&lt;?&gt; bs=4m
</code></pre>
<p>Once the USB stick is made, boot onto the SD Card and follow the install procedure.
Once Ubuntu is installed, continue with the instructions below.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#install-dependencies" id="install-dependencies"><h3>Install dependencies</h3></a>
<p>Install Git.</p>
<pre><code>sudo apt-get install git
</code></pre>
<a class="header" href="print.html#configure-the-raspberry-pi" id="configure-the-raspberry-pi"><h3>Configure the Raspberry Pi</h3></a>
<a class="header" href="print.html#installing-ros-1" id="installing-ros-1"><h3>Installing ROS</h3></a>
<p>Once Ubuntu is installed, we need to configure the sources to accept software from the ROS repositories:</p>
<pre><code>sudo sh -c 'echo &quot;deb http://packages.ros.org/ros/ubuntu $(lsb_release -sc) main&quot; &gt; /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros-latest.list'
sudo apt-key adv --keyserver hkp://ha.pool.sks-keyservers.net:80 --recv-key 421C365BD9FF1F717815A3895523BAEEB01FA116
</code></pre>
<p>After that, you can install ROS by issuing the following commands:</p>
<pre><code>sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-desktop-full
</code></pre>
<p>This may take a while...</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> To find available ROS packages you can use the following command:</p>
<pre><code>apt-cache search ros-kinetic
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<a class="header" href="print.html#setup-ros" id="setup-ros"><h3>Setup ROS</h3></a>
<p>Initialize rosdep:</p>
<pre><code>sudo rosdep init
rosdep update
</code></pre>
<p>ROS needs to setup a lot of environment variables to work properly. It is easier if they are loaded automatically
when you launch a terminal. To do this, we copy the setup code into our <code>.bashrc</code> file:</p>
<pre><code>echo &quot;source /opt/ros/kinetic/setup.bash&quot; &gt;&gt; ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
</code></pre>
<a class="header" href="print.html#install-dependencies-to-build-packages" id="install-dependencies-to-build-packages"><h3>Install dependencies to build packages</h3></a>

</code></pre>
<a class="header" href="print.html#ros-1" id="ros-1"><h1>Ros</h1></a>
<p>ROS starts with the ROS Master. The Master allows all other ROS pieces of software (Nodes) to find and talk to each other. That way, we do not have to ever specifically state “Send this sensor data to that computer at 127.0.0.1. We can simply tell Node 1 to send messages to Node 2. But... how do Nodes do this? By publishing and subscribing to <code>TOPICS</code>.</p>
<p>The ROS Master provides name registration and lookup to the rest of the Computation Graph.</p>

</blockquote>
<a class="header" href="print.html#nodes" id="nodes"><h1>Nodes</h1></a>
<p>Nodes are executables that can communicate with other processes using topics,
services, or the Parameter Server. Using nodes in ROS provides us with fault
tolerance and separates the code and functionalities, making the system simpler.</p>
<p>A node must have a unique name in the system. This name is used to permit the
node to communicate with another node using its name without ambiguity.</p>
<p>ROS has tools to handle nodes and give us information about it, such as <code>rosnode</code>.</p>
<p>The rosnode tool is a command-line tool used to display information about nodes,
such as listing the currently running nodes. The supported commands are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>rosnode info NODE</code>: This prints information about a node</li>
<li><code>rosnode kill NODE</code>: This kills a running node or sends a given signal</li>
<li><code>rosnode list</code>: This lists the active nodes</li>
<li><code>rosnode machine hostname</code>: This lists the nodes running on a particular machine or lists machines</li>
<li><code>rosnode ping NODE</code>: This tests the connectivity to the node.</li>
<li><code>rosnode cleanup</code>: This purges the registration information from unreachable nodes</li>
</ul>
<a class="header" href="print.html#topics" id="topics"><h1>Topics</h1></a>
<p>Topics are buses used by nodes to transmit data. Topics can be transmitted without a
direct connection between nodes, which means that the production and consumption
of data are decoupled. A topic can have various subscribers and can also have
various publishers, but you can take care about publishing the same topic with
different nodes because it can create conflicts.</p>
<p>Each topic is strongly typed by the ROS message type used to publish it, and nodes
can only receive messages from a matching type. A node can subscribe to a topic
only if it has the same message type.</p>
<p>ROS has a tool to work with topics called <code>rostopic</code>. It is a command-line tool
that gives us information about the topic or publishes data directly on the network.
This tool has the following parameters:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>rostopic list</code>: This prints information about active topics.</li>
<li><code>rostopic pub /topic type args</code>: This publishes data to the topic.
It allows us to create and publish data in whatever topic we want,
directly from the command line.</li>
<li><code>rostopic echo /topic</code>: This prints messages to the screen.</li>
<li><code>rostopic find message_type</code>: This finds topics by their type.</li>
<li><code>rostopic info /topic</code>: This prints information about the active topic,</li>
<li><code>rostopic hz /topic</code>: This displays the publishing rate of the topic.
topics published, ones it is subscribed to, and services.</li>
<li><code>rostopic type /topic</code>: This prints the topic type, that is, the type of
message it publishes.</li>
<li><code>rostopic bw /topic</code>: This displays the bandwidth used by the topic.</li>
</ul>
<a class="header" href="print.html#messages" id="messages"><h1>Messages</h1></a>
<p>A node sends information to another node using messages that are published
by topics. The message has a simple structure that uses standard types or types
developed by the user.</p>
<p>Message types use the following standard ROS naming convention; the name of the
package, then /, and then the name of the .msg file. For example, <strong>std_msgs/msg/String.msg</strong> has the <strong>std_msgs/String</strong> message type.</p>
<p>ROS has the <code>rosmsg</code> command-line tool to get information about messages. The
accepted parameters are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>rosmsg show</code>: This displays the fields of a message</li>
<li><code>rosmsg list</code>: This lists all messages</li>
<li><code>rosmsg package</code>: This lists all of the messages in a package</li>
<li><code>rosmsg packages</code>: This lists all of the packages that have the message</li>
<li><code>rosmsg users</code>: This searches for code files that use the message type</li>
</ul>
<a class="header" href="print.html#workspaces" id="workspaces"><h1>Workspaces</h1></a>
<p>The first thing you will want to do before you write code is create an environnement for your project. This environnement is called <em>Workspace</em>. The Workspace is the root folder containing subfolders and files essential to run your project.
These files will be generated using the <strong>catkin_init_workspace</strong> command.</p>
<p>Let's get into it!
<br><br></p>
<ul>
<li>Choose a directory for your workspace, let's use 'catkin_ws'</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>mkdir -p ~/catkin_ws/src
cd ~/catkin_ws/src
catkin_init_workspace
</code></pre>
<p>This will create a <strong>CMakeLists.txt</strong> file in your <strong>/src</strong> folder.
<br><br></p>
<ul>
<li>Then we will make the project</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>cd ~/catkin_ws
catkin_make
</code></pre>
<p>This will create two subfolders, <strong>build</strong> and <strong>devel</strong>. The <strong>build</strong> folder is none of our interest in most of the part. The <strong>devel</strong> folder contains a number of files and directories, the most interesting of which are the setup files. Running these configures your system to use this workspace, and the code that’s (going to be) contained inside it.
<br><br></p>
<ul>
<li>Configure your machine to use this Workspace</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>source devel/setup.bash
</code></pre>
<p>That's it, you've got your workspace up and running!</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#ros-packages" id="ros-packages"><h1>ROS Packages</h1></a>
<p>ROS software is organized into packages, each of which contains some combination of code, data, and documentation. Usually there is a package for each 'function' of your robot. For example, you can have a package for navigation or for sensor capturing.
Thanks to the contributing community, there are many pre built packages available to download for free.</p>
<p>Let's create our first package!</p>
<ul>
<li>Creating a packages</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>cd ~/catkin_ws/src
catkin_create_pkg my_awesome_code rospy
</code></pre>
<p>This creates a new package named <strong>my_awesome_code</strong>. Inside that folder we'll find a <strong>/src</strong> directory where we will put our python code.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#complementary-info" id="complementary-info"><h2>Complementary info</h2></a>
<a class="header" href="print.html#roscore" id="roscore"><h3>roscore</h3></a>
<p>The <code>roscore</code> command is a service that provides connection information to nodes so that they can transmit messages to one another. <strong>It is necessary to run this command before launching any package</strong>.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#rosrun" id="rosrun"><h3>rosrun</h3></a>
<p>To run a package, we use the <code>rosrun</code> command executed like this:</p>
<pre><code>rosrun PACKAGE EXECUTABLE [ARGS]
</code></pre>
<p><strong>PACKAGE</strong> is the name of the created package, for example <strong>my_awesome_code</strong>, and <strong>EXECUTABLE</strong> is the name of the python file containing the code. <strong>Attention!</strong> The python file needs to be executable, juste use <code>sudo chmod +x file.py</code></p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#publisher-node" id="publisher-node"><h1>Publisher Node</h1></a>
<p>As shortly mentioned in the basic concept part, ROS allows interaction pulisher nodes and subscriber nodes.

<a class="header" href="print.html#launch-files" id="launch-files"><h1>Launch files</h1></a>
<p>Launch files are very common in ROS to both users and developers. They provide a convenient way to start up multiple nodes and a master, as well as other initialization requirements such as setting parameters.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#roslaunch" id="roslaunch"><h2>Roslaunch</h2></a>
<p><code>roslaunch</code> is used to open launch files. This can be done by either specifying the package the launch files are contained in followed by the name of the launch file, or by specifying the file path to the launch file.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">roslaunch package_name launch_file arg1:=value arg2:=value
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>roslaunch will also start <code>roscore</code> if no master has been set. Pushing <code>Ctrl-C</code> in a terminal with a launch file running will close all nodes that were started with that launch files.</p>
</blockquote>
<a class="header" href="print.html#writing-a-launch-files" id="writing-a-launch-files"><h2>Writing a .launch files</h2></a>
<p>Launch files are of the format .launch and use a specific XML format. They can be placed anywhere within a package directory, but it is common to make a directory named <strong>Launch</strong> inside the workspace directory to organize all your launch files. The contents of a launch file must be contained between a pair of launch tags</p>
<pre><code class="language-xml">&lt;launch&gt;&lt;!-- Content here --&gt;&lt;/launch&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>To actually start a node, the <code>&lt;node&gt;</code> tags are used, the <strong>pkg</strong>, <strong>type</strong> and <strong>name</strong> argument are required.</p>
<pre><code class="language-xml">&lt;node pkg=&quot;...&quot; type=&quot;...&quot; name=&quot;...&quot; respawn=true/&gt;
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>pkg, type and name</code>: The argument <strong>pkg</strong> points to the package associated with the node that is to be launched, while <strong>type</strong> refers to the name of the node executable file.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>respawn or required</code>: However optional, it’s common to either have a respawn argument or a required argument, but not both. If <strong>respawn=true</strong>, then this particular node will be restarted if for some reason it closed. <strong>required=true</strong> will do the opposite, that is, it will shut down all the nodes associated with a launch file if this particular node comes down. There are other optional argument available on the ROS wiki.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>arg</code>: Sometimes it is necessary to use a local variable in launch files. This can be done using</p>
</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-xml">&lt;arg name=&quot;...&quot; value=&quot;...&quot;&gt;
</code></pre>
<a class="header" href="print.html#parameter-server" id="parameter-server"><h1>Parameter server</h1></a>
<p>Configuration information in ROS is usually saved to the Parameter server. The Parameter sever is a collection of values that can be accessed upon request through the command prompt, nodes or launch files. Parameters are intended to be fairly static, globally available values such as integers, floats, strings or bool values.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#parameters" id="parameters"><h2>Parameters</h2></a>
<p>Parameters are named using the normal ROS naming convention. This means that ROS parameters have a hierarchy that matches the namespaces used for topics and nodes. This hierarchy is meant to protect parameter names from colliding.</p>
<pre><code>/motors/front/left: 5.0
/motors/front/right: 4.0
/motors/rear/left: 4.0
/motors/rear/right: 5.0
</code></pre>
<p>The parameter <code>/motors/front/left</code> has the value <code>5.0</code>. You can also get the value for <code>/motors/front</code>, which is the dictionary</p>
<pre><code>left: 5.0
right: 4.0
</code></pre>
<p>And you can also get the value for <code>/motors</code>, which has a dictionary of dictionaries representation of the parameter tree:</p>
<pre><code>front: { left: 5.0, right: 4.0 }
rear: { left: 4.0, right: 5.0 }
</code></pre>
<a class="header" href="print.html#parameters-from-the-terminal" id="parameters-from-the-terminal"><h2>Parameters from the terminal</h2></a>
<p>ROS has a tool called <code>rosparam</code> to manage Parameter Server. The accepted parameters are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>rosparam set parameter value</code>: This sets the parameter</li>
<li><code>rosparam get parameter</code>: This gets the parameter</li>
<li><code>rosparam load file</code>: This loads parameters from the file</li>
<li><code>rosparam dump file</code>: This dumps parameters to the file</li>
<li><code>rosparam delete parameter</code>: This deletes the parameter</li>
<li><code>rosparam list</code>: This lists the parameter names</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, we can see the parameters in the server that are used by all nodes:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">rosparam list
</code></pre>
<p>We obtain the following output for the above example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">/motors/front/left
/motors/front/right
/motors/rear/left
/motors/rear/right
</code></pre>
<p>If you want to read a value, you will use the <code>get</code> parameter:</p>
<pre><code>rosparam get /motors/front/left
</code></pre>
<p>To set a new value, you will use the <code>set</code> parameter:</p>
<pre><code>rosparam set /motors/front/left 6.0
</code></pre>
<a class="header" href="print.html#accessing-parameters-from-nodes" id="accessing-parameters-from-nodes"><h2>Accessing parameters from nodes</h2></a>
<p>It is often the case that your nodes will have to access the parameter server during start up to retrieve configuration information, or set a parameter value. This can be done quite easily in Python, to set a parameter use:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">rospy.param_set(/motors/front/left, 6.0)
rospy.param_get(/motors/front/left)
</code></pre>
<a class="header" href="print.html#accessing-parameters-from-launchfiles" id="accessing-parameters-from-launchfiles"><h2>Accessing parameters from launchfiles</h2></a>
<p>The final source where you may need to access the parameter server is from a launch file. Setting a parameter value during a launch file is common practice to conveniently initialize parameters on start up. This can be done in your launch file using</p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml">&lt;param name=&quot;/motors/front/left&quot; value=&quot;6.0&quot;/&gt;
</code></pre>
<a class="header" href="print.html#ros-and-arduino" id="ros-and-arduino"><h1>ROS and Arduino</h1></a>
<a class="header" href="print.html#what-is-rosserial-" id="what-is-rosserial-"><h2>What is rosserial ?</h2></a>
<p>« Rosserial is a protocol for wrapping standard ROS serialized messages and multiplexing multiple topics and services over a character device such as a serial port or network socket.<br />
Rosserial provides a ROS communication protocol that works over your Arduino's UART. It allows your Arduino to be a full fledged ROS node which can directly publish and subscribe to ROS messages, publish TF transforms, and get the ROS system time.<br />
The rosserial protocol is aimed at point-to-point ROS communications over a serial transmission line. We use the same serialization/de-serialization as standard ROS messages, simply adding a packet header and tail which allows multiple topics to share a common serial link. »</p>
<p>These explanations come from the following websites :<br />
http://wiki.ros.org/rosserial<br />
http://wiki.ros.org/rosserial_arduino/Tutorials/Arduino%20IDE%20Setup</p>
<p>Now you know what rosserial is used for, but before testing you have to install some packages.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#rosserial-installation" id="rosserial-installation"><h2>Rosserial installation</h2></a>
<p>To install and use rosserial you have to run the terminal, first update apt-get which allows you to install packages :</p>
<pre><code>sudo apt-get update
</code></pre>
<p>You can choose to install the packages one by one :</p>
<p>First type :</p>
<pre><code>sudo apt-get install arduino
</code></pre>
<p>Then after the first installation :</p>
<pre><code>sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-rosserial
</code></pre>
<p>And then :</p>
<pre><code>sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-rosserial-arduino
</code></pre>
<p>Or you can directly install all the packages with one command in the terminal :</p>
<pre><code>sudo apt-get install -y \
                arduino \
                ros-kinetic-rosserial-arduino \
                ros-kinetic-rosserial
</code></pre>
<a class="header" href="print.html#rosserial-sonar-simple-test" id="rosserial-sonar-simple-test"><h2>Rosserial sonar simple test</h2></a>
<p>To test if you receive the messages published by the Arduino on the Rasperry Pi you have to do the following :<br />
To test it you first have to upload the code you can find at the end of this tutorial (which you can also find on the Github repo of the Ecam Eurobot : <a href="https://github.com/Ecam-Eurobot/Eurobot-2018/blob/ultrasound/arduino/sonar.ino">https://github.com/Ecam-Eurobot/Eurobot-2018/blob/ultrasound/arduino/sonar.ino</a>). If you need further information and explanations for this code, you can refer to the Sonar Sensor Tutorial in the Electronics part. You can also use that tutorial for the wiring of the sonar on your Arduino. Of course you have to choose the pin numbers so they correspond to the ones declared in the code previously mentionned or you can directly change in the code the pin numbers yourself.<br />
Then you have to connect the Arduino board to the Raspberry. To do so you can simply connect them with the serial Arduino cable to the Raspberry USB port as shown on the figure below.</p>
<p><img src="img/software/ros/arduino/rasp_arduino_connection.png" alt="img" /></p>
<p>Image reference :<br />
<a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Raspberry-Pi-Arduino-Serial-Communication/">http://www.instructables.com/id/Raspberry-Pi-Arduino-Serial-Communication/</a></p>
<p>After that, you have to launch the terminal and execute the following commands :</p>
<p>on a first window you type :</p>
<pre><code>roscore
</code></pre>
<p>on another window :</p>
<pre><code>rosrun rosserial_python serial_node.py /dev/ttyUSB0 
</code></pre>
<p>/dev/ttyUSB0 is the usb port the Arduino is connected to so you’ll have to change the «USB0». You can find the name of the port tty* in the Arduino IDE or you can find it in the terminal by typing :</p>
<pre><code>ls /dev/tty*
</code></pre>
<p>when you plug the Arduino in the Raspberry port, you can execute this previous command to see which port has been added and thus know which one is the Arduino board.</p>
<p>Finally you can see what the Arduino is publishing on the topic of one of the ultrasound sensors, for example we will try here with the right ultrasound. You can see it by typing on another terminal window :</p>
<pre><code>rostopic echo /ultrasound_right
</code></pre>

<a class="header" href="print.html#publisher" id="publisher"><h1>Publisher</h1></a>
<p>To use ROS in an Arduino script you first have to include some libraries :</p>
<pre><code class="language-cpp">#include &lt;ros.h&gt;
#include &lt;std_msgs/Type.h&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>You have to replace «Type» with the type of the std message you are using. Here are the different types of std_msgs : <a href="http://wiki.ros.org/std_msgs">http://wiki.ros.org/std_msgs</a>.</p>
<p>You can also use different kind of messages. For instance the ultrasound sensors use :</p>
<pre><code class="language-cpp">#include &lt;sensor_msgs/Range.h&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Then you have to start a ROS node (takes care of serial port communications, allows to create publishers and subscribers) with this line :</p>
<pre><code class="language-cpp">ros::NodeHandle nh;
</code></pre>
<p>You can now create a message object that you will later fill with data and this is the message you will finally publish :</p>
<pre><code class="language-cpp">std_msgs::String msg;
</code></pre>
<p>where msg is the name of the object. And of course you can choose the type of the message depending on the type of the transferred message.</p>
<p>Then you have to choose if you want to create a publisher, a subscriber or even both.</p>
<p>To create a publisher :</p>
<pre><code class="language-cpp">ros::Publisher chatter(&quot;chatter&quot;, &amp;msg);
</code></pre>
<p>This tells that we are going to be publishing a message of the type of the msg variable (with std_msgs::String type) on the topic «chatter». This lets the master tell any nodes listening on «chatter» that we are going to publish data on that topic.</p>
<p>You can now add lines in the void setup() of the Arduino script. You first initialize the node :</p>
<pre><code class="language-cpp">nh.initNode()
</code></pre>
<p>Next, the following call connects to the master to publicize that the node will be publishing messages on the given topic :</p>
<pre><code class="language-cpp">nh.advertise(chatter);
</code></pre>
<p>So finally this is what the void setup() in your Arduino code should look like :</p>
<pre><code class="language-cpp">void setup()
{
   nh.initNode();
   nh.advertise(chatter);
}
</code></pre>
<p>To fill the message object with the data you just have to do this :</p>
<pre><code class="language-cpp">msg.data = hello;
</code></pre>
<p>where hello is the data you put in your message and hello must have the same type as the msg variable.</p>
<p>You can then publish you message on the topic. To do so you can either publish it once or continually in the void loop() of your Arduino code like this :</p>
<pre><code class="language-cpp">
void loop()
{
   chatter.publish( &amp;str_msg );
}
</code></pre>
<p>Finally you have to add a last line of code in the loop that will call all the callbacks waiting to be called at that point in time :</p>
<pre><code class="language-cpp">nh.spinOnce();
</code></pre>
<p>Now that you know how each part of the code works you can test a «Hello World» example available on the wiki.ros.org website <a href="http://wiki.ros.org/rosserial_arduino/Tutorials/Hello%20World">http://wiki.ros.org/rosserial_arduino/Tutorials/Hello%20World</a> :</p>

<p>You have to upload this code on the Arduino board before connecting it to the Raspberry and before starting the test on ROS.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#test-on-a-raspberry" id="test-on-a-raspberry"><h1>Test on a Raspberry</h1></a>
<p>To test it you first have to connect the Arduino board to the Raspberry. Then you launch the terminal and execute the following commands :</p>
<p>on a first window you type :</p>
<pre><code>roscore
</code></pre>
<p>on another window :</p>
<pre><code>rosrun rosserial_python serial_node.py /dev/ttyUSB0 
</code></pre>
<p>/dev/ttyUSB0 is the usb port the Arduino is connected to so you’ll have to change the «USB0». You can find the name of the port tty* in the Arduino IDE or you can find it in the terminal by typing :</p>
<pre><code>ls /dev/tty*
</code></pre>
<p>when you plug the Arduino in the Raspberry port, you can execute this previous command to see which port has been added and thus know which one is the Arduino board.</p>
<p>Finally you can see what the Arduino is publishing on a specific topic by typing on another terminal window :</p>
<pre><code>rostopic echo /topic_name
</code></pre>
<p>where you have to replace topic_name by the topic your Arduino is publishing on. In the example above, the «hello world!» is published on the topic «chatter». So you can type :</p>
<pre><code>rostopic echo /chatter
</code></pre>
<a class="header" href="print.html#subscriber" id="subscriber"><h1>Subscriber</h1></a>
<p>To try this tutorial on you Arduino board you have to connect a Led. The pin used here is the 13 but of course you can change it in the code if you want to use another one.</p>
<p>As in the Arduino Publisher Tutorial you first have to include the libraries. One of them depends on the message you are transferring with ROS. In the following example we will choose an empty message. This means that the message doesn’t contain anything. So when the subscriber receives the message, it doesn’t react depending on its content but it only reacts because a message has been sent. As the type of the std_msg is «Empty», you have to include the following lines at the beginning of your Arduino code :</p>
<pre><code class="language-cpp">#include &lt;ros.h&gt;
#include &lt;std_msgs/Empty.h&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Here again, like the Arduino Publisher Tutorial code, you have to start a ROS node with this line :</p>
<pre><code class="language-cpp">ros::NodeHandle nh;
</code></pre>
<p>Then you initiate the callback function where you have to specify the name of the callback (messageCb), the type of the message (std_msgs::Empty) and the name of the message (toggle_msg which contains the transferred message). The callback is the function called each time you receive a message. If toggle_msg had a content you could use it in the callback but it is not the case here as the message is of type «Empty».</p>
<pre><code class="language-cpp">void messageCb( const std_msgs::Empty&amp; toggle_msg){
  digitalWrite(13, HIGH-digitalRead(13));   // blink the led
}
</code></pre>
<p>The following line of code is used to instantiate the subscriber. To do so you have to specify two arguments : the topic name (we chose in this example : «toggle_led») and the callback function we defined previously (messageCb).</p>
<pre><code class="language-cpp">ros::Subscriber&lt;std_msgs::Empty&gt; sub(&quot;toggle_led&quot;, &amp;messageCb );
</code></pre>
<p>As this is a blink led example, in the setup part of your Arduino code you first have to use the number 13 pin as an output.</p>
<pre><code class="language-cpp">pinMode(13, OUTPUT);
</code></pre>
<p>Then for the ROS part of the setup you have to first initialize the node :</p>
<pre><code class="language-cpp">nh.initNode();
</code></pre>
<p>And subscribe to the node you want to :</p>
<pre><code class="language-cpp">nh.subscribe(sub);
</code></pre>
<p>So finally this is what the void setup() in your Arduino code should look like :</p>
<pre><code class="language-cpp">void setup()
{
  pinMode(13, OUTPUT);
  nh.initNode();
  nh.subscribe(sub);
}
</code></pre>
<p>Finally you just have to add in the void loop of your Arduino code the following lines where the spinOnce passes arguments to the callback :</p>
<pre><code class="language-cpp">void loop()
{
  nh.spinOnce();
  delay(1);
}
</code></pre>
<p>Now that you know how each part of the code works you can test the blink led example available on the wiki.ros.org website <a href="http://wiki.ros.org/rosserial_arduino/Tutorials/Blink">http://wiki.ros.org/rosserial_arduino/Tutorials/Blink</a> :</p>
<pre><code class="language-cpp">/*

#include &lt;ros.h&gt;
#include &lt;std_msgs/Empty.h&gt;

ros::NodeHandle nh;

  digitalWrite(13, HIGH-digitalRead(13));   // blink the led
}

ros::Subscriber&lt;std_msgs::Empty&gt; sub(&quot;toggle_led&quot;, &amp;messageCb );

void setup()
{
  pinMode(13, OUTPUT);
  nh.initNode();
  nh.subscribe(sub);
}

{
  nh.spinOnce();
  delay(1);
}

<p>You have to upload this code on the Arduino board before connecting it to the Raspberry and before starting the test on ROS.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#test-on-a-raspberry-1" id="test-on-a-raspberry-1"><h1>Test on a Raspberry</h1></a>

<p>when you plug the Arduino in the Raspberry usb port, you can execute this previous command to see which port has been added and thus know which one is the Arduino board.</p>
<p>Finally, in order to send a single message to the Arduino, you can publish on a specific topic by typing on another terminal window :</p>
<pre><code>rostopic pub toggle_led std_msgs/Empty --once
</code></pre>
<p>where toggle_led is the topic you are publishing on, std_msgs/Empty is the type of the message and we use «—once» to publish this message only once.</p>

<a class="header" href="print.html#summary" id="summary"><h4>Summary</h4></a>
<p>First and foremost, we must connect to GoPro wifi to take a picture of the color combination. Here, we have chosen a GoPro as a camera because it has an acceptable quality (780 pixel-HD) and it has also a Wi-Fi module for the remote control.</p>
<p>Once the photo has been taken, the camera automatically switches off and we connect to the robot by wifi (a Raspberry connected with the same Wi-Fi for future image treatment).</p>
<p>During this treatment, we use the OpenCV free graphics library.</p>
<p>We have drawn three frames on the picture (one for each cube to detect) to delimit the test portion. The board analyzes all pixels within each frame to obtain the color.</p>
<p>However, we have implemented in our program the different possible combinations to save time. Indeed, we only required two colors to deduce the final combination.</p>
<p>As a matter of conclusion, we send combination to the robot by ROS.</p>

<p>You'll see 3 colors frames on the picture and the final combination color on the terminal as shown in the image below</p>
<p><img src="img/software/image-processing/image6.png" alt="z" /></p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#image-processing---color_detectionpy" id="image-processing---color_detectionpy"><h2>Image processing - color_detection.py</h2></a>
<p>After taking a picture with the camera or the GoPro, we must process it to generate the color combination :
The program creates three frames, one for each cube and analyzes all pixels within each frame:</p>
<ol>
<li>It looks whether the color detected is in the range color defined for every color (each color range is defined with one high and one low BGR value)</li>
<li>After that, it returns a value: more the value is great, more the color lies within the range. The program adds up the values and the final value thus obtained determines the color within the range of colors determined initially.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Adjusting the position of a frame</strong></p>
<p>We must adjust the position of frames to target the part of the image we want to process :<br />
Each position is represented by a matrice. The first value (pixel) is linked with red frame, the second value (pixel) with yellow frame and the last value (pixel) with white frame.</p>
<p><img src="img/software/image-processing/image2.png" alt="before" /></p>
<p><em>positionName = [red frame value, yellow frame value, white frame value]</em></p>
<p>Here is the different positions for each frame:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>xmin</strong> is the left side of the frame</li>
<li><strong>xmax</strong> is the right side par of the frame</li>
<li><strong>ymin</strong> is the top side of the frame</li>
<li><strong>ymax</strong> is the bottom side of the frame</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Procedure</strong> :</p>
<ol>
<li>Maintain your cursor where you want to place a side of the frame</li>
<li>Take note of the position (pixel)</li>
<li>Open a new tab (<strong><em>ctrl+shift+t</em></strong>) and run this command to change a side of a frame in the following code(color_detection.py) :</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>nano color_detection.py 
</code></pre>
<ol start="4">
<li>Restart for another side of the frame then save the file (<strong><em>ctrl+x</em></strong>)</li>
</ol>
<p><strong><em>Result</em></strong> :</p>
<p><img src="img/software/image-processing/image3.png" alt="after" /></p>
<p><strong>Adjusting the range color</strong></p>
<p>We must adjust the color range (RBG) to define each color. Therefore, the programme will be able to identify differents colors in each frame in function of these RGB values. We represente  each color range by a matrix :</p>
<p><em>color_range = [blue value, green value, red value]</em></p>
<p>As a reminder, an RGB color value is specified with RGB (red, green, blue).
Each parameter (red, green, and blue) defines the intensity of the color as an integer between 0 and 255.
For example, rgb(0, 0, 255) is rendered as blue, because the blue parameter is set to its highest value (255) and the others are set to 0.</p>
<p><strong>Procedure</strong> :</p>
<ol>
<li>Maintain your cursor in the center of the cube</li>
<li>Take note of the RGB color</li>
<li>Open a new tab (<strong><em>ctrl+shift+t</em></strong>) and change the color range in the code (color_detection.py)</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>nano color_detection.py 
</code></pre>
<ol start="4">
<li>Restart for another cube then save the file (<strong><em>ctrl+x</em></strong>)</li>
</ol>
<p><strong><em>Result</em></strong> :</p>
<p><img src="img/software/image-processing/image4.png" alt="z" /></p>
<p><strong>Automation</strong></p>
<p>We have also implemented in our program the different possible combinations to save time. Indeed, we only required two colors to deduce the final combination.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#application-with-ros" id="application-with-ros"><h2>Application with ROS</h2></a>
<p>You use <strong><em>ROS</em></strong> to send the color combination to another robot module :</p>
